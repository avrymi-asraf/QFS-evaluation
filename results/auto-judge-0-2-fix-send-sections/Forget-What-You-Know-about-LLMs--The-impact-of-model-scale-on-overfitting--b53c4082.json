SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify how reliant Large Language Models (LLMs) are on specific prompt phrasing rather than true language understanding. By systematically rephrasing benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic content and labels, C-BOD exposes overfitting. The study found that LLMs, particularly larger ones and those with higher baseline accuracy on benchmarks like MMLU, tend to exhibit significant performance degradation when faced with these rephrased inputs. This suggests a strong tendency for larger and higher-performing models to overfit to the superficial patterns and fixed prompt structures present in widely used evaluation datasets. Conversely, models like the Llama family and those with lower initial accuracy showed less degradation, indicating a reduced dependency on such cues. The findings challenge the community to move beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize evaluating LLMs for resilience and generalization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy are more vulnerable to overfitting on benchmark-specific prompt patterns, showing greater performance degradation when prompts are rephrased.\n*   The C-BOD framework systematically distorts benchmark prompts to detect this overfitting, revealing that many LLMs rely on surface cues rather than true understanding.\n*   An average performance drop of 2.15% was observed across evaluated LLMs under modest prompt rephrasing, with 20 out of 26 models showing statistically significant declines.\n*   Models like the Llama family demonstrated greater robustness to prompt variations, suggesting that architectural choices and training strategies can mitigate overfitting.\n*   The research advocates for evaluations that prioritize resilience and generalization over solely relying on high scores on static benchmarks.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to assess Large Language Models' (LLMs) vulnerability to overfitting on benchmark datasets. C-BOD works by systematically rephrasing benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic content and labels. By evaluating LLMs on both original and rephrased prompts, C-BOD detects whether high performance is due to memorized patterns rather than true language understanding. The study found that many LLMs, particularly larger ones and those with higher baseline accuracy, exhibit significant performance degradation when faced with these rephrased prompts. This suggests a paradox where top-performing models might be over-relying on surface-level cues. The framework aims to encourage a shift in LLM evaluation towards prioritizing resilience and generalization over raw benchmark scores. While effective for detecting surface-level overfitting, C-BOD's current limitations include overlooking deeper forms of overfitting and the computational cost associated with its application in training pipelines.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify how much Large Language Models (LLMs) overfit to specific benchmark prompts. By systematically rephrasing benchmark questions while preserving their semantic content, C-BOD exposes LLMs that rely on surface-level cues rather than true language understanding. The study found that LLMs, particularly larger ones and those with higher baseline accuracy, tend to exhibit significant performance degradation when faced with these rephrased prompts. This suggests a paradox where high performance on standard benchmarks might mask an overreliance on memorized patterns. The Llama family of models, and those with lower baseline accuracy, showed more stability, indicating reduced dependency on superficial cues. C-BOD's dataset-agnostic design allows for integration into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding, challenging the community to prioritize resilience over leaderboard scores. However, the method's current limitations include a focus on textual rephrasing and potential high computational costs for training integration.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy are more vulnerable to overfitting, showing greater performance drops when benchmark prompts are rephrased.\n*   A paradox exists where LLMs achieving high scores on standard benchmarks may be over-relying on dataset-specific cues rather than demonstrating true generalization.\n*   The Llama family of models demonstrated notable stability against prompt perturbations, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial patterns.\n*   The C-BOD framework detects overfitting by measuring performance degradation under controlled textual distortions, aiming to promote more robust LLM evaluation practices.\n*   The current methodology primarily targets surface-level textual overfitting and may not capture deeper forms of model vulnerability.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to expose LLMs' reliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic content, revealing overfitting by measuring performance degradation. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs show an average performance drop of 2.15% under modest rephrasing. Notably, larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more vulnerable to these perturbations, indicating a potential overreliance on fixed prompt patterns. Conversely, models like the Llama family and those with lower initial accuracy exhibit less degradation, suggesting better generalization. This highlights a paradox in LLM evaluation: high benchmark scores may mask an underlying sensitivity to prompt variations, underscoring the need to prioritize resilience. The C-BOD framework is dataset-agnostic and can be integrated into training to promote more robust language understanding, though it primarily targets textual overfitting and can be computationally intensive.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy are more prone to performance degradation when prompts are rephrased, suggesting a reliance on surface-level cues.\n*   A paradox exists where high performance on standard benchmarks might mask an LLM's vulnerability to prompt variations, indicating a potential lack of true generalization.\n*   The Llama family of models demonstrated greater stability and less performance degradation under prompt perturbations compared to many other LLMs.\n*   C-BOD detects overfitting by measuring performance drops on semantically equivalent but rephrased prompts, revealing that many LLMs rely on specific phrasing rather than robust understanding.\n*   The framework primarily targets textual overfitting, and its application in training pipelines can be computationally costly, with potential for overlooking deeper forms of overfitting.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify how LLMs overfit to specific benchmark prompts by systematically rephrasing questions while preserving their semantic content. The study found that a significant majority of leading LLMs (20 out of 26) exhibit performance degradation when faced with these rephrased prompts, indicating a reliance on superficial cues rather than true language understanding. Notably, larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more vulnerable to these perturbations, suggesting a paradox where high benchmark scores may mask underlying overfitting. The Llama family of models stood out for its stability across different scales. The authors highlight that traditional evaluations might be misleading, as high scores could be due to memorization of prompt patterns. C-BOD's dataset-agnostic nature allows for integration into training pipelines to foster more robust models. The primary limitation is its focus on textual overfitting, with deeper forms of overfitting and computational costs for mitigation being areas for future work.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy are more prone to performance degradation when prompts are rephrased, suggesting a paradox where high scores can mask overfitting.\n*   The C-BOD framework reveals that most LLMs (20/26) overfit to benchmark-specific prompt patterns, showing significant performance drops when prompts are altered.\n*   The Llama family of models demonstrated remarkable stability and reduced dependency on superficial cues across various scales, unlike many other LLMs.\n*   High benchmark scores in LLMs may not always translate to robust generalization, as models can exploit surface-level cues present in canonical prompt formats.\n*   C-BOD primarily detects textual overfitting and does not address deeper forms of overfitting or the computational cost associated with mitigation strategies.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to uncover LLM overreliance on benchmark-specific surface cues. By systematically rephrasing benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic content, C-BOD exposes how performance degrades when models encounter variations. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs revealed an average accuracy drop of 2.15% on rephrased inputs, with 20 models showing statistically significant performance differences. A key finding is that larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more vulnerable to these perturbations, indicating a potential over-reliance on fixed prompt patterns. Conversely, models like the Llama family and those with lower baseline accuracy demonstrated greater stability. This highlights a paradox in LLM evaluation: high benchmark scores may mask a lack of true generalization, emphasizing the need for more robust evaluation methods that prioritize resilience.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy are more susceptible to performance degradation when benchmark prompts are rephrased, suggesting they overfit to specific linguistic patterns.\n*   The C-BOD framework reveals that many LLMs exhibit significant performance drops (average 2.15%) on rephrased prompts, indicating a reliance on surface cues rather than genuine understanding.\n*   Models like the Llama family demonstrated stability against prompt perturbations, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues.\n*   High benchmark scores can be misleading, as they may not reflect true generalization capabilities but rather an over-reliance on dataset-specific formatting.\n*   The study's focus is primarily on textual overfitting; deeper forms of overfitting and the computational cost of mitigation remain limitations.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify overfitting in Large Language Models (LLMs) by systematically rephrasing benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic meaning. The study reveals that many LLMs over-rely on surface-level cues, leading to significant performance degradation when prompts are altered. Notably, larger models and models with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more vulnerable to these perturbations, indicating a potential trade-off between scale/performance and robust generalization. The Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy demonstrated greater stability. This highlights a paradox in LLM evaluation: high benchmark scores may mask an over-reliance on specific prompt patterns rather than true language understanding. C-BOD offers a dataset-agnostic approach to uncover these vulnerabilities and promote more resilient LLMs.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n* Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy are more susceptible to performance degradation when benchmark prompts are rephrased, suggesting a tendency to overfit to specific prompt patterns.\n* The Llama family of models demonstrated notable stability against prompt perturbations, indicating reduced dependency on superficial cues.\n* A paradox exists where LLMs achieving high scores on standard benchmarks may be exploiting dataset-specific cues, not exhibiting true language understanding or generalization.\n* C-BOD detects overfitting by measuring performance drops on semantically equivalent but rephrased prompts, revealing vulnerabilities that traditional benchmarks might miss.\n* Current overfitting detection methods like C-BOD primarily focus on textual rephrasing and may not capture deeper forms of overfitting, while mitigation strategies can incur significant computational costs.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD) to assess how LLMs rely on surface-level cues in benchmarks rather than true language understanding. C-BOD systematically rephrases benchmark prompts, preserving semantic content, and measures performance degradation. The study found that 20 out of 26 leading LLMs exhibited statistically significant performance drops on rephrased prompts, averaging 2.15%. Notably, larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy showed greater sensitivity to these rephrasings, indicating a tendency to overfit to specific prompt patterns. The Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy demonstrated more stability. This highlights a paradox where high benchmark scores may mask underlying vulnerabilities, suggesting a need to prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluations. The framework is dataset-agnostic but primarily targets textual overfitting, with computational cost being a limitation for mitigation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n* Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy are more vulnerable to overfitting on benchmark-specific prompt patterns, showing greater performance degradation when prompts are rephrased.\n* The Llama family of models demonstrated notable stability against prompt perturbations, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues.\n* A paradox exists where high benchmark scores do not necessarily equate to robust generalization; models performing well on standard benchmarks can be highly sensitive to prompt variations.\n* C-BOD reveals that a significant portion of LLMs (20 out of 26 tested) overfit to benchmark phrasing, leading to an average performance drop of 2.15% on rephrased inputs.\n* The framework's primary limitation is its focus on textual overfitting, potentially overlooking deeper forms of model vulnerability, and the computational cost associated with mitigation strategies.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify how reliant Large Language Models (LLMs) are on specific prompt phrasing in benchmarks. By systematically rephrasing benchmark questions while preserving their semantic meaning, C-BOD exposes LLMs that overfit to surface-level cues rather than demonstrating true language understanding. The study found that a significant majority of leading LLMs (20 out of 26) exhibited performance degradation when faced with these rephrased prompts, averaging a 2.15% drop in accuracy. Notably, larger models (higher parameter counts) and models with higher baseline accuracy on standard benchmarks tended to be more vulnerable to these perturbations, indicating a potential paradox where exceptional performance on traditional evaluations might mask an overreliance on memorized patterns. Conversely, models like the Llama family showed greater stability, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues. The findings challenge the community to look beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize robustness and generalization in LLM evaluation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy are generally more susceptible to performance degradation when prompts are rephrased, suggesting a correlation between model scale/performance and overfitting vulnerability.\n*   The study reveals a paradox where high performance on standard benchmarks may mask an overreliance on dataset-specific cues rather than true generalization.\n*   The Llama family of models demonstrated notable stability against prompt rephrasing, indicating a reduced dependency on superficial patterns.\n*   C-BOD's methodology highlights that many LLMs overfit to prompt phrasing, leading to significant performance drops when inputs are subtly altered.\n*   The framework's findings imply a need to re-evaluate current LLM evaluation practices to prioritize resilience and generalization over raw benchmark scores.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to uncover LLMs' overreliance on benchmark-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. C-BOD systematically distorts prompts while preserving semantic content and labels, revealing if performance is driven by memorized patterns. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs showed an average performance degradation of 2.15% on rephrased inputs, with 20 models exhibiting statistically significant drops. A key finding is the correlation between model scale and overfitting vulnerability: larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to rephrasing, indicating they may over-rely on fixed prompt patterns. Similarly, models with higher baseline accuracy also showed larger performance differences, creating a paradox where high benchmark scores may mask underlying vulnerabilities. The Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy demonstrated reduced degradation, suggesting less dependency on superficial cues.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Larger LLMs tend to be more susceptible to overfitting, exhibiting greater performance degradation when prompts are rephrased.\n*   Models with higher baseline accuracy on original benchmarks are also more prone to performance drops when encountering prompt variations.\n*   A paradox exists where high benchmark scores might indicate over-reliance on surface-level cues rather than true generalization.\n*   The Llama family of models demonstrated notable stability against prompt perturbations, suggesting reduced overfitting.\n*   C-BOD reveals that many LLMs overfit to specific prompt phrasing and structures, impacting their robustness.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to uncover LLMs' overreliance on benchmark-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. C-BOD systematically distorts prompts while preserving semantic content and labels, revealing if performance is driven by memorized patterns. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs showed an average performance degradation of 2.15% on rephrased inputs, with 20 models exhibiting statistically significant drops. A key finding is the correlation between model scale and overfitting vulnerability: larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to rephrasing, indicating they may over-rely on fixed prompt patterns. Similarly, models with higher baseline accuracy also showed larger performance differences, creating a paradox where high benchmark scores may mask underlying vulnerabilities. The Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy demonstrated reduced degradation, suggesting less dependency on superficial cues.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Larger LLMs tend to be more susceptible to overfitting, exhibiting greater performance degradation when prompts are rephrased.\n*   Models with higher baseline accuracy on original benchmarks are also more prone to performance drops when encountering prompt variations.\n*   A paradox exists where high benchmark scores might indicate over-reliance on surface-level cues rather than true generalization.\n*   The Llama family of models demonstrated notable stability against prompt perturbations, suggesting reduced overfitting.\n*   C-BOD reveals that many LLMs overfit to specific prompt phrasing and structures, impacting their robustness.",
