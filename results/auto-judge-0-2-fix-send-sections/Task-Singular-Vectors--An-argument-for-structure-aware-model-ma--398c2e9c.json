      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper argues for a structure-aware approach to model manipulation, specifically in the context of model merging, moving beyond flattened parameter representations. The authors introduce \"Task Singular Vectors\" (TSVs) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices. They demonstrate that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs captures most of the task-specific information. This insight leads to TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a method that compresses task vectors by 10x while retaining 99% accuracy. Crucially, the interaction between TSVs from different tasks is used to define and reduce \"Singular Task Interference\" (STI). The proposed TSV-Merge (TSV-M) method combines this compression with interference reduction, significantly outperforming existing model merging techniques by achieving a more geometrically informed integration of task-specific knowledge. This structure-aware manipulation addresses the limitations of flattened approaches by directly tackling inter-task interference.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Model merging methods that treat networks as flat parameter vectors overlook crucial structural information and are prone to task interference.\n*   Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices reveals their low-rank nature, with Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) capturing essential task-specific information.\n*   TSV-Compress (TSV-C) leverages this low-rank property to compress task vectors by 10x while preserving 99% accuracy.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines compression with a novel interference reduction technique based on the interaction of TSVs, leading to state-of-the-art performance in model merging.\n*   This structure-aware manipulation offers a more effective way to combine models compared to flattened parameter approaches.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper argues for a structure-aware approach to model manipulation, specifically in the context of model merging, over traditional flattened parameter methods like Task Arithmetic (TA). TA treats entire networks as flat vectors, ignoring crucial structural information and leading to task interference. The proposed method, TSV-Merge (TSV-M), leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices to extract Task Singular Vectors (TSVs). These TSVs capture task-specific contributions at a granular, layer-wise level. The research demonstrates that layer task matrices are inherently low-rank, enabling TSV-Compress (TSV-C) to compress task vectors significantly (to 10% of their size) while retaining 99% accuracy. Furthermore, TSV-M utilizes the geometric properties of TSVs to define and reduce task interference by decorrelating singular vectors across tasks via a whitening transformation. This structure-aware approach demonstrably outperforms flattened methods, achieving state-of-the-art results by effectively combining compression with interference reduction. The analysis confirms that both components are crucial for optimal performance, with interference reduction being the primary driver of accuracy gains.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Flattened parameter approaches like Task Arithmetic overlook crucial structural information and are prone to task interference.\n*   Task Singular Vectors (TSVs), derived from the SVD of per-layer task matrices, offer a structure-aware representation for model manipulation.\n*   Layer task matrices are low-rank, enabling significant compression (TSV-C) with minimal accuracy loss.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) reduces task interference by decorrelating TSVs using a whitening transformation, leading to superior model merging performance.\n*   The combination of low-rank approximation and interference reduction in TSV-M significantly outperforms existing methods.",

The authors introduce Task Singular Vectors (TSVs), derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices. This layer-level analysis reveals that task matrices are inherently low-rank, allowing for significant compression. Their proposed method, TSV-Compress (TSV-C), achieves a 10x compression while retaining 99% accuracy. Crucially, the TSV framework allows for a fine-grained measure of task interference (STI) based on the geometric interaction of singular vectors. By decorrelating these vectors using a whitening transformation, TSV-Merge (TSV-M) effectively reduces interference, significantly outperforming existing flattened approaches like Task Arithmetic. Ablation studies confirm that both low-rank compression and interference reduction are vital for TSV-M's superior performance, with interference reduction being the primary driver. The approach also demonstrates that interference decreases in deeper layers and that TSV-Merge does not require a tunable scaling coefficient.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Flattened parameter approaches (like Task Arithmetic) overlook crucial structural information, leading to limitations in model merging.\n*   Analyzing per-layer task matrices using SVD reveals their low-rank nature, enabling effective compression (TSV-C) with minimal accuracy loss.\n*   Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) provide a geometric basis to measure and reduce task interference, a key limitation of flattened methods.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M), by combining low-rank compression and TSV decorrelation (whitening), significantly outperforms existing methods by mitigating task interference.",

The authors introduce Task Singular Vectors (TSVs), derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices, to capture task-specific information within the natural structure of neural networks.

The authors introduce \"Task Singular Vectors\" (TSVs) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices. This layer-level analysis reveals that task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs can represent a task's contribution effectively. This insight leads to TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a method that compresses task vectors to 10% of their size while retaining 99% accuracy. Furthermore, the interaction of TSVs across tasks provides a more granular measure of \"Singular Task Interference\" (STI) than flattened approaches. By decorrelating these singular vectors using a whitening transformation, TSV-Merge (TSV-M) reduces this interference, significantly outperforming existing methods by combining compression with interference mitigation. The ablation studies confirm that both low-rank approximation and interference reduction are crucial for TSV-M's superior performance, with interference reduction being the primary driver.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Flattened parameter approaches overlook crucial structural information, leading to coarse-grained interaction measures.\n*   Layer-level analysis using Singular Value Decomposition reveals Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) and the low-rank nature of task matrices.\n*   TSV-Compress (TSV-C) compresses task vectors by 10x while retaining 99% accuracy.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) decorrelates TSVs to reduce \"Singular Task Interference\" (STI), outperforming flattened methods.\n*   Both low-rank approximation and interference reduction are critical for TSV-M's performance gains.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper argues for a structure-aware approach to model manipulation, specifically for model merging, by analyzing per-layer task matrices using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This contrasts with flattened parameter approaches like Task Arithmetic, which overlook crucial structural information and are prone to task interference. The authors introduce Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) as the core components derived from SVD. They demonstrate that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, allowing for significant compression (TSV-Compress, TSV-C) down to 10% of original size while retaining 99% accuracy. More importantly, the interaction of TSVs across different tasks is used to define and mitigate task interference (Singular Task Interference, STI). Their proposed TSV-Merge (TSV-M) method combines this low-rank compression with interference reduction via a whitening transformation on TSVs, leading to state-of-the-art performance in model merging by significantly reducing interference and improving accuracy compared to existing methods.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Flattened parameter approaches like Task Arithmetic ignore crucial structural information within neural network layers, leading to task interference.\n*   Analyzing per-layer task matrices via SVD reveals a low-rank structure, enabling efficient compression (TSV-Compress) while preserving high accuracy.\n*   Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) provide a basis for measuring and reducing task interference, a key limitation of previous methods.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines low-rank compression with TSV decorrelation (whitening) to achieve superior model merging performance by effectively mitigating task interference.",

The authors introduce Task Singular Vectors (TSVs), derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices. This decomposition reveals that task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs can represent a layer's function with high fidelity. This insight leads to TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a method that compresses task vectors to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% of accuracy. Crucially, the interaction of TSVs across tasks provides a fine-grained measure of task interference. Leveraging this, TSV-Merge (TSV-M) is proposed, which combines compression with interference reduction through a whitening transformation of TSVs. This structure-aware approach significantly outperforms flattened methods like Task Arithmetic by directly addressing task interference, leading to state-of-the-art results in model merging.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Flattened parameter approaches like Task Arithmetic overlook crucial structural information, leading to susceptibility to task interference.\n*   Per-layer task matrices exhibit a low-rank structure, allowing for compression using Task Singular Vectors (TSVs).\n*   TSV-Compress (TSV-C) achieves significant compression (10% size) while preserving high accuracy (99%).\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) explicitly reduces task interference by decorrelating TSVs, outperforming methods that don't consider this structural interaction.\n*   Structure-aware methods like TSV-M are essential for effective model merging, leading to substantial accuracy improvements over flattened approaches.",

The authors introduce \"Task Singular Vectors\" (TSVs) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices. This approach recognizes that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs can represent a layer's function effectively. This insight leads to TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a method that compresses task vectors to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% of accuracy. Crucially, the interaction of TSVs across different tasks provides a fine-grained measure of task interference. Building on this, TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines compression with interference reduction by decorrelating TSVs, significantly outperforming existing flattened parameter approaches like Task Arithmetic. The study demonstrates that while low-rank approximation offers some benefits, the combination with interference reduction is key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in model merging.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Flattened parameter approaches overlook crucial structural information, limiting their ability to manage task interference.\n*   Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) derived from per-layer SVD capture task-specific contributions and reveal low-rank properties.\n*   TSV-Compress (TSV-C) achieves significant compression (90%) with minimal accuracy loss (1%), leveraging the low-rank nature of TSVs.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) decorrelates TSVs across tasks to reduce interference, significantly outperforming flattened methods and achieving state-of-the-art results.",

The authors introduce Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices. This layer-level analysis reveals that task matrices are inherently low-rank, allowing for significant compression (TSV-C) while retaining high accuracy. Crucially, the TSVs provide a geometrically informed basis to measure and reduce task interference, a problem plaguing flattened approaches like Task Arithmetic. By decorrelating TSVs from different tasks using a whitening transformation, their TSV-Merge (TSV-M) method effectively mitigates interference, leading to state-of-the-art performance in model merging. The study demonstrates that combining low-rank approximation with interference reduction yields superior results compared to either component alone, offering a more efficient and effective alternative to methods that treat models as flat vectors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Flattened parameter approaches overlook crucial structural information, leading to limitations in model merging and susceptibility to task interference.\n*   Analyzing per-layer task matrices via SVD reveals a low-rank structure, enabling efficient compression (TSV-C) while preserving accuracy.\n*   Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) provide a method to quantify and reduce task interference by decorrelating singular vectors across tasks (TSV-M).\n*   TSV-Merge, combining low-rank compression and interference reduction, significantly outperforms flattened methods and establishes a new state-of-the-art in model merging.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper argues for a structure-aware approach to model manipulation, specifically for model merging, by moving beyond flattened parameter representations. The authors introduce Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices. This layer-level analysis reveals that task matrices are inherently low-rank, allowing for significant compression (TSV-C) while retaining high accuracy. Crucially, the TSVs provide a geometrically informed basis to measure and reduce task interference, a problem plaguing flattened approaches like Task Arithmetic. By decorrelating TSVs from different tasks using a whitening transformation, their TSV-Merge (TSV-M) method effectively mitigates interference, leading to state-of-the-art performance in model merging. The study demonstrates that combining low-rank approximation with interference reduction yields superior results compared to either component alone, offering a more efficient and effective alternative to methods that treat models as flat vectors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Flattened parameter approaches overlook crucial structural information, leading to limitations in model merging and susceptibility to task interference.\n*   Analyzing per-layer task matrices via SVD reveals a low-rank structure, enabling efficient compression (TSV-C) while preserving accuracy.\n*   Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) provide a method to quantify and reduce task interference by decorrelating singular vectors across tasks (TSV-M).\n*   TSV-Merge, combining low-rank compression and interference reduction, significantly outperforms flattened methods and establishes a new state-of-the-art in model merging.",
