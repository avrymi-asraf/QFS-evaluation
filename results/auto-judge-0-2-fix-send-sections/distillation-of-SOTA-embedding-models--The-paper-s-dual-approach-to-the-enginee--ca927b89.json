SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art performance for its size, rivaling 7 billion parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard. The core of Jasper's engineering success lies in its dual approach to embedding dimensionality. Firstly, a novel multi-stage distillation framework is employed, enabling Jasper to learn from multiple larger teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5) using three carefully designed losses: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. This process progressively transfers knowledge, first training a fully connected layer, then fine-tuning additional encoder layers. Secondly, to address the high dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher embeddings, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized. This involves introducing additional fully connected layers to effectively compress the student model's vector representation into lower dimensions, such as 512, while maintaining performance.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a multi-stage distillation process using cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss to learn from multiple large teacher models.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is integrated to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model, creating manageable output sizes like 512 dimensions.\n*   The dual approach of distillation from multiple teachers and MRL-based dimension reduction allows Jasper (2B parameters) to achieve performance comparable to larger 7B parameter models.\n*   The distillation process is structured in four stages, progressively transferring knowledge and incorporating dimension reduction, with a final stage for multimodal potential.",

SUMMARY:\nThe paper addresses the challenge of high dimensionality in state-of-the-art embedding models by employing a dual approach: multi-stage distillation and Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). The distillation process involves a smaller student model learning from multiple larger teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 with 4096 dimensions and Stella_en_1.5B_v5 with 8192 dimensions) across four stages. Initially, the student model's output is mapped to a combined dimensionality of 12288. A key aspect of the engineering approach is the rationale for omitting the cosine loss (Lcosine) in Stage 3, which focuses on dimension reduction. This omission is because the reduced vector dimensions generated by the new FC layers do not align with the concatenated teacher vector dimensions, making direct angular comparison with Lcosine unsuitable. The paper also introduces a self-distillation method where earlier stage outputs serve as teachers for shorter vectors, distinct from MRL's direct dimension reduction. The separate dimension reduction stage (Stage 3) is necessary to handle the impractically large 12288-dimensional vectors produced after concatenating teacher outputs, making the model more efficient for real-world applications.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The student model's initial output is mapped to a combined dimensionality of 12288 by concatenating teacher model vectors (4096 from NV-Embed-v2 and 8192 from Stella_en_1.5B_v5).\n*   Lcosine is omitted in Stage 3 (dimension reduction) because the reduced vector dimensions do not align with the concatenated teacher vector dimensions, making direct angular comparison inappropriate.\n*   A self-distillation approach is proposed where aligned vectors from earlier stages act as teachers for shorter vectors, offering an alternative to standard MRL.\n*   A dedicated dimension reduction stage is crucial to manage the significantly increased vector dimensionality resulting from concatenating multiple teacher models.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThe paper addresses the challenge of high dimensionality in state-of-the-art embedding models by employing a dual approach: multi-stage distillation and Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). The distillation process involves a smaller student model learning from multiple larger teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 with 4096 dimensions and Stella_en_1.5B_v5 with 8192 dimensions) across four stages. Initially, the student model's output is mapped to a combined dimensionality of 12288. A key aspect of the engineering approach is the rationale for omitting the cosine loss (Lcosine) in Stage 3, which focuses on dimension reduction. This omission is because the reduced vector dimensions generated by the new FC layers do not align with the concatenated teacher vector dimensions, making direct angular comparison with Lcosine unsuitable. The paper also introduces a self-distillation method where earlier stage outputs serve as teachers for shorter vectors, distinct from MRL's direct dimension reduction. The separate dimension reduction stage (Stage 3) is necessary to handle the impractically large 12288-dimensional vectors produced after concatenating teacher outputs, making the model more efficient for real-world applications.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The student model's initial output is mapped to a combined dimensionality of 12288 by concatenating teacher model vectors (4096 from NV-Embed-v2 and 8192 from Stella_en_1.5B_v5).\n*   Lcosine is omitted in Stage 3 (dimension reduction) because the reduced vector dimensions do not align with the concatenated teacher vector dimensions, making direct angular comparison inappropriate.\n*   A self-distillation approach is proposed where aligned vectors from earlier stages act as teachers for shorter vectors, offering an alternative to standard MRL.\n*   A dedicated dimension reduction stage is crucial to manage the significantly increased vector dimensionality resulting from concatenating multiple teacher models.",
