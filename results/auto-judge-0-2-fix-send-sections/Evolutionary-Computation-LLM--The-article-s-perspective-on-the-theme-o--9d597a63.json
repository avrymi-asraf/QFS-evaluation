LLMs can act as sophisticated search operators, leveraging their vast domain knowledge and text processing capabilities to guide EA searches more intelligently and efficiently. This is particularly beneficial for complex problems with large search spaces where traditional EAs might struggle. LLMs can also assist in generating novel optimization algorithms themselves. Conversely, EAs are presented as a framework to optimize LLMs, especially in black-box scenarios where direct gradient access is unavailable. EAs can optimize LLM prompts (prompt engineering) and even their underlying architectures, leading to more tailored and efficient LLMs. The synergy between LLMs and EAs is seen as a promising avenue for tackling complex optimization and generation tasks across various domains, including code generation and neural architecture search.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs can enhance EAs in black-box optimization by acting as intelligent search operators, leveraging their domain knowledge and text processing abilities.\n*   EAs can be used to optimize LLMs in black-box settings, particularly through prompt engineering and neural architecture search.\n*   The combination of LLMs and EAs offers complementary strengths for complex optimization and generation tasks.\n*   LLMs can also be used to generate new optimization algorithms, further integrating with EA methodologies.",

SUMMARY:\nThis article positions large language models (LLMs) as powerful tools that can enhance evolutionary algorithms (EAs), particularly in the context of black-box optimization. The authors highlight that while LLMs have limitations in their inherent search capabilities and can be considered \"black-boxes\" themselves, EAs offer a flexible global search framework that can further improve LLM performance. Specifically, EAs can optimize LLM prompts and even their underlying architecture, leading to more efficient and effective solutions. Conversely, the domain knowledge embedded within LLMs can guide EA searches, making them more intelligent and faster. The paper details how LLMs can act as sophisticated evolutionary operators, generating new solutions or even entire optimization algorithms. This synergy is seen as a crucial advancement for tackling complex problems with vast search spaces, where traditional methods might struggle. The article surveys existing research and proposes a roadmap for future work, emphasizing the potential of this collaboration to drive innovation in optimization and artificial intelligence.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   EAs can enhance LLMs by optimizing their prompts and architectures, thereby improving their black-box optimization capabilities.\n*   LLMs, with their inherent domain knowledge, can guide EAs to perform more intelligent and efficient searches.\n*   LLMs can function as advanced evolutionary operators, generating novel solutions or even entire optimization algorithms for EAs.\n*   The combined strengths of LLMs and EAs are particularly beneficial for tackling complex optimization problems with large and uncertain search spaces.",

LLMs, despite their impressive capabilities, are criticized for their black-box nature and inflexible search. EAs, as established black-box optimization techniques, can be integrated to provide flexible global search, particularly for optimizing LLM prompts and neural architectures. Conversely, LLMs offer abundant domain knowledge and text processing abilities that can guide EA searches, making them more intelligent and efficient. The synergy between LLMs and EAs is explored through LLM-enhanced EAs (e.g., LLMs as search operators, algorithm generators) and EA-enhanced LLMs (e.g., EA for prompt engineering and architecture search). Applications span code generation, software engineering, and neural architecture search, demonstrating the complementary strengths of both approaches in tackling complex problems with vast search spaces.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   EAs can enhance LLMs by providing flexible global search capabilities within LLM's black-box settings, particularly for optimizing prompts and neural architectures.\n*   LLMs can guide EA searches with their domain knowledge and text processing abilities, leading to more intelligent and efficient optimization.\n*   LLM-assisted black-box optimization involves using LLMs as search operators (e.g., OPRO, LMX, LMEA) to generate new solutions.\n*   EA-based prompt engineering techniques, such as EvoPrompt and PromptBreeder, use EAs to optimize textual or continuous prompts for LLMs.\n*   EA-based LLM architecture search leverages EAs to automate the discovery and optimization of LLM architectures, aiming for improved performance and efficiency.",

LLMs can enhance EAs by providing domain knowledge, generating novel solutions, and even creating new optimization algorithms. Conversely, EAs can improve LLMs through techniques like prompt engineering and Neural Architecture Search (NAS). The paper highlights that LLMs, despite their black-box nature, can be optimized by EAs using gradient-free methods. Specific EA techniques, such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and CMA-ES, are employed for optimizing discrete and continuous prompts respectively, with examples ranging from improving LLM outputs to enhancing security. For LLM architecture, EAs automate the search for optimal configurations, aiming for better performance and reduced model size. The synergy between LLMs and EAs is further demonstrated across diverse applications like code generation, software engineering, and NAS, where LLMs provide intelligent evolutionary operators and EAs offer robust search frameworks. However, challenges remain in applying these combined methods to complex, large-scale optimization problems due to LLM context limitations and interpretability issues.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs can act as intelligent evolutionary operators or assist in generating optimization algorithms, enhancing EA capabilities in black-box settings.\n*   EAs are crucial for optimizing LLM prompts (discrete and continuous) and architectures, improving their performance and efficiency.\n*   Techniques like Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and CMA-ES are widely used in EA-based prompt engineering and NAS.\n*   The integration of LLMs and EAs shows significant promise across applications such as code generation, software engineering, and neural architecture search.\n*   Challenges persist in applying LLM-assisted EAs to complex, large-scale optimization problems, primarily due to LLM context limitations and interpretability concerns.",

LLMs, despite their power, suffer from a black-box nature and inflexible, limited global search capabilities, often relying on one-shot processes constrained by prompts and training data. EAs, as classic black-box optimization techniques, offer a solution by providing iterative, flexible global search capacities. The paper details how LLMs can be utilized as search operators within EA frameworks, improving solutions through iterative refinement and enabling more flexible searches than LLMs alone. This synergy is explored through various methods like OPRO and LMX, which leverage LLMs for generating new solutions or acting as variation operators. Challenges remain, particularly in applying LLMs to complex, large-scale, or constrained optimization problems due to context limitations and interpretability issues, but the potential for LLMs to guide EA search with their domain knowledge is significant.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   EAs are presented as a crucial optimization framework to enhance LLMs' black-box nature and limited global search capabilities.\n*   LLMs can act as intelligent search operators within EAs, generating novel solutions and improving iterative optimization processes.\n*   Methods like OPRO and LMX demonstrate how LLMs can be integrated into EA variation operators for more flexible and effective searching.\n*   Challenges exist in applying LLMs to complex, large-scale, or constrained optimization problems due to LLM context limitations and interpretability concerns.\n*   LLMs' domain knowledge can significantly guide EA searches, leading to more intelligent and efficient optimization.",

SUMMARY:\nThe article positions evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as a powerful framework for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) within black-box settings, particularly for global search capabilities. Conversely, LLMs can enrich EA by providing abundant domain knowledge for more intelligent searches. The paper categorizes this synergy into LLM-enhanced EA and EA-enhanced LLM. For LLM-enhanced EA, LLMs act as search operators in black-box optimization, exemplified by methods like OPRO and LMX, and are used to generate novel optimization algorithms. However, current LLMs face challenges with complex, large-scale optimization due to limited context understanding and interpretability. For EA-enhanced LLM, EAs are crucial for prompt engineering, optimizing both discrete and continuous prompts (e.g., EvoPrompt, BBT) and for automating LLM architecture search (e.g., AutoBERT-Zero). The integrated synergy of LLMs and EAs is driving advancements across diverse applications like code generation and software engineering.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   EAs provide a black-box optimization framework to enhance LLMs' global search capabilities, while LLMs offer domain knowledge to guide EA.\n*   LLMs can act as search operators in black-box optimization (e.g., OPRO, LMX) and assist in generating optimization algorithms, but struggle with complex, large-scale problems due to context and interpretability limitations.\n*   EAs are vital for LLM prompt engineering (e.g., EvoPrompt, BBT) and for automating Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for LLMs, improving efficiency and design.\n*   The combined synergy of LLMs and EAs is a significant trend, driving innovation in areas like code generation, software engineering, and NAS.",

LLMs can act as intelligent search operators, leveraging their vast knowledge to guide EA's exploration and exploit promising solutions. Techniques like Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO) and Language Model Crossover (LMX) exemplify this, where LLMs generate new solutions based on optimization trajectories or parent solutions. LLMs also assist in EA by automatically generating optimization algorithms, either through single-round or iterative methods, and by providing domain knowledge to improve EA's search. Conversely, EAs enhance LLMs through prompt engineering, where evolutionary algorithms optimize prompts for better LLM performance, and through automating LLM architecture search (NAS). The synergy is evident in applications like code generation and software engineering, where LLMs provide code understanding and EAs guide the search for optimized solutions. However, challenges remain, including LLMs' limited context and interpretability in complex, large-scale optimization problems.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs can serve as intelligent search operators within EAs, guiding optimization through generated solutions and leveraging prior knowledge.\n*   EAs enhance LLMs by optimizing prompts for improved performance and by automating the search for optimal LLM architectures.\n*   LLMs assist EAs in generating optimization algorithms and can imbue EAs with domain-specific knowledge for more efficient searches.\n*   While promising, LLMs face challenges in handling complex, large-scale optimization due to limited context and interpretability.\n*   The synergy between LLMs and EAs is demonstrated in applications like code generation and software engineering, where LLMs provide code understanding and EAs drive iterative search.",

SUMMARY:\nThis article explores the synergistic relationship between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), particularly their application in black-box optimization. It highlights how LLMs can act as powerful search operators within EA frameworks, enhancing their ability to navigate complex search spaces and optimize solutions, especially in black-box settings where internal model details are inaccessible. The article details methods like Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO) and Language Model Crossover (LMX) where LLMs generate new solutions or guide evolutionary processes. Conversely, EAs are shown to enhance LLMs through prompt engineering, optimizing LLM inputs for better performance, and through Neural Architecture Search (NAS), automating the design of more efficient LLM architectures. The paper categorizes this interplay into LLM-enhanced EA and EA-enhanced LLM, with specific focus on LLM-assisted black-box optimization and EA-based prompt engineering techniques. It also surveys applications like code generation and software engineering, demonstrating the practical benefits of this collaboration, while acknowledging challenges like LLM interpretability and context limitations in complex optimization tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs can serve as flexible global search operators within Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) for black-box optimization, enhancing their ability to generate and refine solutions.\n*   Methods like OPRO and LMX leverage LLMs to iteratively improve solutions or act as variation operators in evolutionary processes.\n*   EAs are crucial for optimizing LLM prompts (prompt engineering) and automating Neural Architecture Search (NAS), leading to improved LLM performance and design.\n*   The synergy between LLMs and EAs is demonstrated in applications such as code generation and software engineering, though LLM limitations in complex optimization and interpretability remain challenges.",

LLMs can act as sophisticated search operators, generating novel solutions and improving iterative optimization processes. This is exemplified by methods like OPRO (Optimization by PROmpting) and LMX (Language Model Crossover), which leverage LLMs to produce new offspring or solutions based on existing ones and optimization trajectories. LLMs also aid in algorithm generation by creating novel optimization techniques, either through single-round or iterative generation processes. Conversely, EAs enhance LLMs, notably through prompt engineering, where techniques like EvoPrompt and PromptBreeder use EAs to optimize discrete textual prompts, and methods like Black-Box Tuning (BBT) employ EAs (e.g., CMA-ES) for continuous, gradient-free prompt optimization. EAs also automate Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for LLMs, aiming to discover more efficient and specialized model designs. The synergy between LLMs and EAs is crucial for tackling complex and large-scale optimization problems, where LLMs' broad knowledge and text processing capabilities complement EAs' global search abilities.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs can function as advanced search operators within EAs, improving optimization through methods like OPRO and LMX.\n*   EAs are utilized to optimize LLM prompts (discrete and continuous), enhancing LLM performance without requiring gradient access.\n*   EA-based Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates the design of more efficient LLM architectures.\n*   The combination of LLMs and EAs is vital for addressing complex and large-scale optimization challenges, leveraging their complementary strengths.\n*   LLMs can also assist in generating novel optimization algorithms for EAs, through both single-round and iterative approaches.",

SUMMARY:\nThis article posits that Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as a powerful optimization framework within black-box settings, enhancing Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) with flexible global search capabilities. Conversely, LLMs' inherent domain knowledge can guide EAs towards more intelligent searches, while their text processing and generative prowess facilitate EA deployment across various tasks. The paper categorizes this reciprocal inspiration into LLM-enhanced EA and EA-enhanced LLM. Specifically, LLMs can act as black-box search operators, exemplified by methods like OPRO and LMX, to optimize solutions or generate new ones. EAs, in turn, are crucial for prompt engineering (e.g., discrete and continuous prompt optimization with techniques like BBT using CMA-ES) and automating LLM architecture search (e.g., AutoBERT-Zero, SuperShaper). The synergy is evident in applications like code generation, software engineering, and Neural Architecture Search (NAS), though challenges remain in LLM context understanding and interpretability for complex, large-scale optimizations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs can enhance EAs by acting as flexible global search operators in black-box optimization, improving upon traditional methods.\n*   EAs are instrumental in optimizing LLMs through prompt engineering (discrete and continuous) and automating LLM architecture search.\n*   The synergy between LLMs and EAs is demonstrated in applications like code generation, software engineering, and Neural Architecture Search.\n*   Challenges for LLMs in black-box optimization include limited context understanding and interpretability, which EAs can help mitigate.",

KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs can enhance EAs by acting as flexible global search operators in black-box optimization, improving upon traditional methods.\n*   EAs are instrumental in optimizing LLMs through prompt engineering (discrete and continuous) and automating LLM architecture search.\n*   The synergy between LLMs and EAs is demonstrated in applications like code generation, software engineering, and Neural Architecture Search.\n*   Challenges for LLMs in black-box optimization include limited context understanding and interpretability, which EAs can help mitigate.",
