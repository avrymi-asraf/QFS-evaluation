SUMMARY:\nThis study explores strategies for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints, specifically focusing on a 1.5B parameter model. The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset. Their experiments demonstrate that by balancing problem difficulty and using a cosine reward function to control output length, they could achieve rapid reasoning gains, significantly improving accuracy on benchmarks like AMC23 (from 63% to 80%) and AIME24 (reaching 46.7%). This was accomplished with only 7,000 samples and a minimal training cost of $42, a stark contrast to the thousands of dollars and massive datasets typically required for larger models. The findings highlight the efficacy of RL-based fine-tuning for small LLMs, offering a cost-effective and scalable approach for resource-constrained environments, while also identifying challenges like optimization instability and length constraints with prolonged training.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) using RL with a compact dataset (7,000 samples) and minimal resources (4x A40 GPUs, 24 hours).\n*   Curating a dataset that balances problem difficulty and employing a cosine reward function to manage output length are key strategies for enhancing RL training efficiency in small LLMs.\n*   The approach achieved competitive performance (e.g., AIME24 at 46.7%) at a drastically reduced cost ($42) compared to larger models requiring thousands of dollars and extensive data.\n*   While effective, challenges like optimization instability and language drift can emerge with prolonged training or insufficient length constraints, especially with multilingual base models.",

The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset, utilizing only 7,000 samples. Their approach trained a 1.5-billion-parameter model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours, achieving significant reasoning improvements. For instance, AMC23 accuracy rose from 63% to 80%, and AIME24 reached 46.7%, outperforming a baseline model (o1-preview) at a fraction of the cost ($42 vs. thousands). Key findings indicate that small LLMs can rapidly improve with limited high-quality data, but prolonged training under strict length constraints leads to performance degradation. Mixing easy and hard problems and using cosine rewards helped stabilize training and control output length. Limitations include the insufficient maximum completion length for complex problems and potential language drift from the multilingual base model. Future work suggests extending training duration, using monolingual pre-filtering, and exploring hybrid methods to further enhance reasoning in resource-constrained environments.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small LLMs (1.5B parameters) under strict resource constraints (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24 hours) by adapting the GRPO algorithm and curating a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset. The methodology involved filtering existing datasets (s1 and DeepScaleR) using LLMs like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to create a high-quality corpus of ~40,000 mathematical reasoning examples. Experiments explored the impact of data quality, problem difficulty mix, and reward functions on training. Experiment 2, which balanced easy and hard problems with reduced length constraints, showed significant initial gains (AMC23 from 63% to 80%) and stabilized reasoning behavior, demonstrating the benefit of this curated dataset composition. Experiment 3 further refined length control using a cosine reward. The resulting models (Open-RS variants) achieved competitive performance, with Open-RS3 reaching 46.7% on AIME24, surpassing o1-preview, at a dramatically reduced cost ($42) and data volume (7,000 samples). Key limitations included insufficient length constraints for complex problems and multilingual drift from the base model, suggesting future work on extended training, language-specific rewards, and broader domain evaluation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A compact dataset of ~7,000 carefully filtered mathematical reasoning problems, curated using LLMs like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, enabled efficient RL training for small LLMs.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems (Experiment 2) improved early reasoning performance and stabilized training, showing the benefit of a balanced dataset composition.\n*   The cosine reward function effectively controlled output length, enhancing training consistency in Experiment 3.\n*   The final combined dataset size was approximately 39,659 examples, with the s1 dataset filtering process reducing it from 59,029 to 18,615 examples.\n*   Training on 7,000 samples with GRPO achieved competitive reasoning scores (e.g., 46.7% on AIME24) at a significantly lower cost ($42) and shorter training time compared to larger models and extensive datasets.",

The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset. They found that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains with limited data and computational resources, demonstrating significant improvements on benchmarks like AMC23 and AIME24 with a training cost of approximately $42. The dataset curation involved filtering existing corpora (s1 and DeepScaleR) using LLMs like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct, resulting in a final dataset of 39,659 high-quality examples. Experiment 2, which mixed easy and hard problems, showed improved early performance and stabilized reasoning. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward function to control output length, enhancing training consistency. Despite these successes, limitations included optimization instability with prolonged training and length constraints on complex problems. Future directions involve addressing these limitations by extending training, improving language control, and exploring other domains.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis study explores enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small LLMs (1.5B parameters) under strict resource constraints (4 A40 GPUs, 24 hours) using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The methodology involved curating compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning datasets by filtering existing corpora and applying a resource-efficient RL algorithm (GRPO). The s1 dataset underwent a multi-stage filtering process, including using a LaTeX `\\boxed{}` command to identify answers and employing LLMs like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to remove trivial or noisy examples, resulting in a final set of 39,659 examples. Experiment 2 combined 7,000 samples (3000 from open-s1, 3000 from open-deepscaler, and 1000 easier problems) with reduced length constraints, demonstrating improved early performance and stability. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward function to stabilize output lengths, showing promise for training consistency. Results indicate that small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%, AIME24 to 46.7%) with minimal data (7,000 samples) and cost ($42), outperforming larger models on specific benchmarks while addressing limitations like optimization instability and length constraints through dataset composition and reward design.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The study successfully enhanced a 1.5B parameter LLM's reasoning abilities using RL with a compact dataset of 7,000 mathematical reasoning samples, achieving competitive performance at a low cost ($42).\n*   Dataset curation involved multi-stage filtering of existing corpora, using LLMs and specific markers like LaTeX `\\boxed{}` to ensure high quality and relevance for mathematical reasoning.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems in the training dataset (Experiment 2) improved early reasoning performance and stabilized training behavior, supporting the hypothesis that balanced difficulty aids learning.\n*   A cosine reward function (Experiment 3) effectively stabilized output lengths, contributing to more consistent training, though longer completion lengths were still needed for very complex problems.\n*   The research demonstrates that RL fine-tuning is a viable and cost-effective strategy for improving small LLMs' reasoning capabilities, even under severe computational limitations, addressing optimization instability and length constraints through careful dataset and reward engineering.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints. The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset, using a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. They successfully demonstrated significant reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%, AIME24 to 46.7%) within a 24-hour training window on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, with a remarkably low training cost of $42. This approach utilized a curated dataset of 7,000 samples, balancing problem difficulty by mixing easier and harder questions. The cosine reward function was found to effectively stabilize completion lengths. While initial gains were rapid, prolonged training led to instability and length constraint issues, suggesting a need for extended training or dynamic length adjustments. The study highlights the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of RL for small LLMs in resource-limited settings, offering a practical alternative to large-scale methods.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RL-based fine-tuning on a compact dataset (7,000 samples) significantly boosted reasoning in a 1.5B LLM, achieving competitive performance with minimal resources.\n*   The training achieved impressive results like 80% AMC23 accuracy and 46.7% AIME24 accuracy with a low cost of $42, demonstrating cost-effectiveness for resource-constrained environments.\n*   Curating a dataset that balances problem difficulty (mixing easy and hard problems) enhanced initial reasoning performance and stabilized training.\n*   The cosine reward function proved effective in controlling output length, contributing to training consistency, though extended reasoning may require longer completion limits.\n*   Limitations include potential optimization instability and performance degradation with prolonged training under strict length constraints, suggesting future work on extending training duration or adjusting length policies.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small LLMs under strict resource constraints, specifically a 1.5B parameter model trained on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours. The researchers curated a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset by filtering existing corpora like s1 and DeepScaleR, using models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct for quality control. They adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and employed rule-based reward models focusing on accuracy, conciseness (cosine reward), and format. Experiments revealed that even with a small dataset (7,000 samples) and a low training cost ($42), the small LLM achieved significant reasoning gains, outperforming baseline models on benchmarks like AMC23 and AIME24. However, challenges like optimization instability and length constraints emerged with prolonged training. Future work aims to address these limitations by extending training duration and improving language control.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 from 63% to 80%, AIME24 to 46.7%) using RL with a compact dataset (7,000 samples) and minimal resources ($42 cost).\n*   Dataset curation involved filtering existing corpora (s1, DeepScaleR) using models like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct to create a high-quality, mathematically focused training set.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems (Experiment 2) improved early performance and stabilized reasoning, while a cosine reward function (Experiment 3) effectively controlled output length, enhancing training consistency.\n*   Despite gains, prolonged training led to performance degradation and issues with optimization instability and length constraints, highlighting the need for careful balancing of problem difficulty and training duration.\n*   The research offers a cost-effective and resource-efficient alternative to traditional large-scale methods for enhancing LLM reasoning, with released code and datasets for reproducibility.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the efficacy of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under significant resource constraints. The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and meticulously curated a compact dataset of mathematical reasoning problems, balancing difficulty to optimize training efficiency. They trained a 1.5-billion-parameter model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours, achieving notable reasoning improvements. Specifically, AMC23 accuracy rose from 63% to 80%, and AIME24 reached 46.7%, surpassing a strong baseline (o1-preview), all with a training cost of approximately $42 and using only 7,000 samples. The research highlights that while small LLMs can rapidly improve with high-quality, mixed-difficulty data, prolonged training can lead to instability and length constraint issues. The cosine reward function proved effective in controlling output length, though extending length limits is crucial for very complex tasks. These findings demonstrate a cost-effective strategy for developing reasoning-capable small LLMs, addressing resource limitations and offering insights into dataset curation and RL implementation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs (1.5B parameters) can achieve significant reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 from 63% to 80%) via RL under strict resource constraints (4x A40 GPUs, 24h) using a compact, curated dataset (7,000 samples).\n*   A balanced dataset of easy and hard problems, coupled with a cosine reward function for length control, improved early performance and training stability, though limitations like optimization instability and length constraints persist.\n*   The RL approach achieved competitive reasoning performance (e.g., AIME24 at 46.7%) at a fraction of the cost ($42) compared to baseline models requiring thousands of dollars and much larger datasets.\n*   The s1 dataset underwent a multi-stage filtering process using LLMs (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) to isolate high-quality mathematical reasoning examples, reducing the initial pool to 18,615.\n*   Experiment 2's dataset composition, mixing 3,000 samples from open-s1, 3,000 from open-deepscaler, and 1,000 easier problems from raw DeepScaleR, aimed to stabilize training and reduce completion lengths.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small LLMs (1.5B parameters) under strict resource constraints (4 A40 GPUs, 24 hours). The researchers adapted the GRPO algorithm and curated a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset, comprising 7,000 samples. This approach achieved rapid reasoning gains, with AMC23 accuracy improving from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, surpassing a strong baseline (o1-preview), at a significantly lower cost ($42 vs. thousands). Key findings indicate that while small LLMs can benefit quickly from high-quality data, prolonged training under strict length constraints leads to performance degradation and optimization instability. Mixing easier and harder problems, along with using cosine rewards for length control, improved early performance and training stability. However, challenges remain with extreme problem difficulty and multilingual base model language drift. The research provides a cost-effective framework for developing reasoning-capable small LLMs, addressing data efficiency and computational limitations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RL-based fine-tuning can significantly boost reasoning in small LLMs (1.5B parameters) under severe resource constraints.\n*   A curated dataset of 7,000 mathematical reasoning samples, combined with GRPO, achieved substantial performance gains (e.g., AMC23 from 63% to 80%) at a minimal cost ($42).\n*   Early reasoning improvements are rapid (50-100 steps), but prolonged training under strict length limits causes degradation and instability.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems, and using cosine rewards for length control, enhances early performance and training stability.\n*   The approach offers a cost-effective alternative to large-scale training, demonstrating the viability of resource-constrained reasoning enhancement.",
