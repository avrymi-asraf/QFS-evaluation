      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThe staged training methodology for the Jasper embedding model is designed to effectively distill knowledge from larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models into a smaller student model. This approach aims to overcome the practical limitations of SOTA models, such as high parameter counts and vector dimensionality, which hinder their real-world application. The methodology involves a multi-stage process, starting with aligning the student model's output with multiple teachers using carefully designed losses (cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss). These losses progress from specific to broader constraints to enhance learning robustness. Subsequent stages focus on reducing the student model's vector dimensionality using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) and a self-distillation technique, and finally, unlocking multimodal capabilities by aligning visual and textual embeddings. This staged approach allows for a progressive transfer of knowledge, ensuring the student model achieves high performance comparable to much larger models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The staged training allows a smaller student model to distill knowledge from multiple larger teacher embedding models using three distinct loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss.\n*   This multi-stage process progressively transfers knowledge, starting with direct alignment and moving towards broader semantic and relative ranking preservation.\n*   The methodology incorporates Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to effectively reduce the student model's vector dimensionality.\n*   A final stage focuses on multimodal alignment using self-distillation, demonstrating a progressive approach to knowledge transfer and model capability enhancement.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThe rationale behind the staged training methodology in Jasper and Stella stems from the need to effectively distill knowledge from large, state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding models into a smaller student model while optimizing for practical deployment. The process begins with a multi-stage distillation approach using three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (Lcosine), similarity loss (Lsim), and relative similarity distillation loss (Lresim). This sequence of losses progressively broadens the constraints on the student model, starting with aligning absolute text representations (Lcosine), then focusing on semantic agreement between text pairs (Lsim), and finally incorporating relative ranking preferences (Lresim). Stages 1 and 2 focus on this distillation, with Stage 1 training only an initial FC layer, and Stage 2 expanding to include the last three encoder layers of the student model. This sequential training allows for gradual learning and parameter adaptation. Later stages address practical challenges like high vector dimensionality through Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL), where combined teacher vector dimensions (e.g., 4096 + 8192 = 12288) are reduced. The entire process is structured across four distinct stages to systematically transfer knowledge and refine the student model's capabilities.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The staged training methodology uses a sequence of three loss functions (Lcosine, Lsim, Lresim) to progressively broaden learning constraints from specific to general text representation alignment.\n*   Stages 1 and 2 focus on knowledge distillation, with Stage 1 training only an initial FC layer and Stage 2 incorporating the last three encoder layers of the student model.\n*   The training is structured across a total of four stages to facilitate effective knowledge transfer and optimization.\n*   Stage 3 addresses the challenge of high combined teacher model vector dimensions (e.g., 12288) by employing MRL for dimensionality reduction.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThe Jasper model employs a multi-stage distillation methodology to train a smaller embedding model (2B parameters) to learn from larger state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models. This staged approach is crucial for effectively transferring knowledge and progressively improving the student model's capabilities. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from multiple teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5) using a combination of three loss functions: cosine loss (Lcosine), similarity loss (Lsim), and relative similarity distillation loss (Lresim). These losses are designed to shift from specific (absolute representation) to broader (relative ranking) constraints, ensuring robust learning. Stage 1 trains only a fully connected layer (FC1), while Stage 2 additionally trains the last three encoder layers of the student model. Stage 3 addresses the high dimensionality (12288) resulting from concatenating teacher vectors by using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional FC layers. It also explores self-distillation for dimension reduction. Stage 4 focuses on unlocking multimodal potential by aligning visual embeddings with textual embeddings using self-distillation on image-caption pairs. This entire 4-stage process, supported by specific hyperparameters and training details, allows Jasper to achieve performance comparable to much larger models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The staged training methodology progresses from specific to broader knowledge distillation using Lcosine, Lsim, and Lresim, followed by dimension reduction and multimodal alignment.\n*   Stages 1 and 2 progressively train the student model, starting with only an FC layer and then incorporating the last three encoder layers.\n*   Stage 3 utilizes MRL for dimension reduction, addressing the 12288-dimensional output from concatenated teacher models, and explores self-distillation for this purpose.\n*   Stage 4 aims to align visual and textual embeddings through self-distillation using image-caption data.\n*   The overall distillation process is a 4-stage approach designed for effective knowledge transfer and dimensionality reduction.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThe staged training methodology for the Jasper embedding model is designed to efficiently distill knowledge from larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models into a smaller student model, while also reducing vector dimensionality and enabling multimodal capabilities. Stages 1 and 2 progressively train the student model by aligning its output with concatenated teacher vectors (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5). This sequential approach starts by training only a fully connected layer (FC1) in Stage 1, then expands to include the last three encoder layers in Stage 2, allowing for a gradual learning process. Three loss functions—cosine loss (Lcosine), similarity loss (Lsim), and relative similarity distillation loss (Lresim)—are employed. These losses exemplify a shift from specific to broader constraints, starting with direct vector alignment (Lcosine), moving to pair-wise semantic matching (Lsim), and finally incorporating relative ranking preferences (Lresim). Stage 3 focuses on dimension reduction using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) and a self-distillation approach, where the 12288-dimensional vectors from FC1 act as teachers for lower-dimensional outputs. Stage 4 incorporates multimodal training by aligning visual encoder outputs with textual embeddings using self-distillation. This multi-stage process allows Jasper, a 2B parameter model, to achieve performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The staged training methodology progressively transfers knowledge from multiple teacher models to a smaller student model using three carefully designed loss functions (Lcosine, Lsim, Lresim) that shift from specific to broader constraints.\n*   Stages 1 and 2 sequentially train the student model, starting with a linear layer and then incorporating encoder layers, to align with concatenated teacher embeddings, preparing for dimension reduction.\n*   Stage 3 utilizes Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) and a self-distillation mechanism (using the 12288-dimensional vectors as teachers) to effectively reduce the student model's vector dimensionality.\n*   Stage 4 aims to unlock multimodal potential by aligning visual encoder outputs with textual embeddings through a self-distillation process.",

SUMMARY:\nThe rationale for the staged training methodology in Jasper and Stella stems from a multi-stage distillation framework designed to transfer knowledge from large, state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding models to a smaller student model. This approach aims to overcome the practical limitations of large models, such as slow inference and high storage costs. The framework progresses through four stages, each with a specific objective. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from multiple teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5) using three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. These losses exemplify a shift from specific constraints (cosine loss focusing on absolute representation alignment) to broader constraints (similarity loss for pairwise semantic consistency and relative similarity loss for ranking preferences). Stages 1 and 2 also differ in their parameter training, with Stage 1 training only a fully connected layer, while Stage 2 trains both that layer and the last three encoder layers of the student model. Stage 3 addresses the high dimensionality (12,288 dimensions from concatenated teacher vectors) resulting from distillation by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) and a self-distillation mechanism for dimension reduction. Stage 4 focuses on unlocking multimodal capabilities by aligning visual embeddings with textual embeddings using a self-distillation mechanism on image-caption pairs. This staged approach allows for progressive knowledge transfer and refinement, ultimately enabling Jasper to achieve SOTA performance comparable to larger models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The staged training methodology is designed to distill knowledge from multiple large teacher embedding models into a smaller student model, addressing practical deployment challenges.\n*   The three loss functions (cosine, similarity, and relative similarity distillation) illustrate a progression from specific to broader constraints, enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the student model's learning.\n*   The framework employs a four-stage process: initial distillation (Stages 1 & 2), dimension reduction via MRL and self-distillation (Stage 3), and multimodal alignment (Stage 4).\n*   Stages 1 and 2 progressively train parameters, starting with only a fully connected layer and then including the last three encoder layers, to facilitate effective knowledge transfer.\n*   Stage 3 tackles the 12,288 combined teacher vector dimensions by using MRL and self-distillation for efficient dimension reduction.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThe rationale for the staged training methodology in Jasper and Stella stems from a multi-stage distillation framework designed to transfer knowledge from large, state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding models to a smaller student model. This approach aims to overcome the practical limitations of large models, such as slow inference and high storage costs. The framework progresses through four stages, each with a specific objective. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from multiple teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5) using three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. These losses exemplify a shift from specific constraints (cosine loss focusing on absolute representation alignment) to broader constraints (similarity loss for pairwise semantic consistency and relative similarity loss for ranking preferences). Stages 1 and 2 also differ in their parameter training, with Stage 1 training only a fully connected layer, while Stage 2 trains both that layer and the last three encoder layers of the student model. Stage 3 addresses the high dimensionality (12,288 dimensions from concatenated teacher vectors) resulting from distillation by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) and a self-distillation mechanism for dimension reduction. Stage 4 focuses on unlocking multimodal capabilities by aligning visual embeddings with textual embeddings using a self-distillation mechanism on image-caption pairs. This staged approach allows for progressive knowledge transfer and refinement, ultimately enabling Jasper to achieve SOTA performance comparable to larger models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The staged training methodology is designed to distill knowledge from multiple large teacher embedding models into a smaller student model, addressing practical deployment challenges.\n*   The three loss functions (cosine, similarity, and relative similarity distillation) illustrate a progression from specific to broader constraints, enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the student model's learning.\n*   The framework employs a four-stage process: initial distillation (Stages 1 & 2), dimension reduction via MRL and self-distillation (Stage 3), and multimodal alignment (Stage 4).\n*   Stages 1 and 2 progressively train parameters, starting with only a fully connected layer and then including the last three encoder layers, to facilitate effective knowledge transfer.\n*   Stage 3 tackles the 12,288 combined teacher vector dimensions by using MRL and self-distillation for efficient dimension reduction.",
