SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to expose LLMs' overreliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts through parametric transformations, creating perturbed datasets that preserve semantic content and labels. By evaluating LLMs on both original and perturbed datasets and employing statistical tests like McNemar's, C-BOD quantifies performance degradation, indicating overfitting. The study found that on the MMLU benchmark, 20 out of 26 leading LLMs exhibited statistically significant performance drops under modest perturbations, averaging 2.15%. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy were more sensitive to rephrasing, suggesting a tendency to overfit fixed prompt patterns. Conversely, models with lower baseline accuracy showed less degradation. C-BOD's dataset- and model-agnostic design allows for integration into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding, challenging the community to prioritize resilience over superficial leaderboard scores.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts using parametric transformations to detect LLM overfitting to surface cues.\n*   LLMs that perform well on standard benchmarks often show significant performance degradation when prompts are rephrased while preserving semantic content.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more susceptible to overfitting and exhibit greater performance drops under prompt perturbations.\n*   The framework is dataset- and model-agnostic, enabling its integration into training pipelines for more robust LLM development.\n*   The study found an average performance degradation of 2.15% across 26 LLMs on the MMLU benchmark due to prompt rephrasing.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to detect overfitting in Large Language Models (LLMs) by systematically distorting benchmark prompts. The methodology utilizes a distortion operator, Tµ, which rephrases input prompts with varying intensities controlled by a parameter µ, while preserving semantic content and labels. This process generates a perturbed dataset (Dµ) to be evaluated alongside the original dataset (D). The rephrasing prompt used in the experimental setting instructed a generative model (DeepSeek 3) to rephrase questions without altering context or the correct answer. The default distortion parameter µ = 1.0 was employed. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs revealed an average performance degradation of 2.15% on perturbed data. Notably, larger models and models with higher baseline accuracy exhibited greater performance differences, suggesting a reliance on superficial cues. Conversely, models like Llama showed reduced dependency on such cues.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to detect overfitting in Large Language Models (LLMs) by systematically distorting benchmark prompts. The core of the methodology is a distortion operator, Tµ, parameterized by µ (temperature), which generates perturbed versions of original prompts while preserving semantic content. This operator can range from minor synonym substitutions (low µ) to more significant rewording and reordering (moderate to high µ). In their experiments, the authors used DeepSeek 3 as the generative model for rephrasing and set the distortion parameter µ to 1.0. The rephrasing prompt instructed the model to \"Rephrase the following question without changing its context or the correct answer: {question}\".\n\nEvaluations on the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs revealed an average performance degradation of 2.15% on rephrased prompts. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy exhibited more significant performance drops, suggesting a greater reliance on superficial cues. Conversely, models like Llama showed more resilience. The study highlights that high benchmark scores may mask an overreliance on dataset-specific patterns rather than true language understanding, urging a shift in evaluation focus towards robustness and generalization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD uses a distortion operator, Tµ, parameterized by µ, to generate semantically equivalent but textually varied prompts to detect LLM overfitting.\n*   DeepSeek 3 was used as the generative model for rephrasing, with a distortion parameter µ set to 1.0.\n*   An average performance degradation of 2.15% was observed across 26 LLMs on rephrased prompts.\n*   Larger models and models with higher baseline accuracy showed a greater tendency to overfit, experiencing more significant performance drops when prompts were perturbed.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify if Large Language Models (LLMs) overfit to specific prompt patterns in evaluation datasets. The core methodology involves a distortion operator, Tµ, which systematically rephrases benchmark prompts while preserving semantic content. This operator is parameterized by µ (temperature), controlling the degree of textual modification. The framework evaluates LLMs on both original and perturbed datasets, using McNemar's test to statistically assess performance differences. The study found that a significant portion of leading LLMs exhibit performance degradation when prompts are rephrased, with an average accuracy drop of 2.15%. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more susceptible to this overfitting, suggesting a reliance on surface cues rather than true understanding. The researchers used DeepSeek 3 for rephrasing with a µ value of 1.0, and the prompt \"Rephrase the following question without changing its context or the correct answer: {question}\" was employed. C-BOD is dataset-agnostic and can be integrated into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding, addressing a gap in existing methods that fail to capture this form of overfitting.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD uses a parametric distortion operator (Tµ) to systematically rephrase prompts, preserving semantics but altering surface cues to detect LLM overfitting.\n*   The methodology employs McNemar's test to statistically validate performance drops caused by these rephrasing perturbations.\n*   Experiments revealed an average accuracy degradation of 2.15% across 26 LLMs when evaluated on rephrased MMLU benchmark prompts (using µ=1.0 and DeepSeek 3 for rephrasing).\n*   Larger models and those with higher initial benchmark accuracy showed a greater tendency to overfit to prompt phrasing.\n*   The approach addresses a gap by detecting overfitting to benchmark-specific artifacts, which prior methods like n-gram overlap or embedding similarity miss, and can be integrated into training for improved robustness.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify if Large Language Models (LLMs) overfit to specific prompt patterns in evaluation datasets. The core methodology involves a distortion operator, Tµ, which systematically rephrases benchmark prompts while preserving semantic content. This operator is parameterized by µ (temperature), controlling the degree of textual modification. The framework evaluates LLMs on both original and perturbed datasets, using McNemar's test to statistically assess performance differences. The study found that a significant portion of leading LLMs exhibit performance degradation when prompts are rephrased, with an average accuracy drop of 2.15%. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more susceptible to this overfitting, suggesting a reliance on surface cues rather than true understanding. The researchers used DeepSeek 3 for rephrasing with a µ value of 1.0, and the prompt \"Rephrase the following question without changing its context or the correct answer: {question}\" was employed. C-BOD is dataset-agnostic and can be integrated into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding, addressing a gap in existing methods that fail to capture this form of overfitting.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD uses a parametric distortion operator (Tµ) to systematically rephrase prompts, preserving semantics but altering surface cues to detect LLM overfitting.\n*   The methodology employs McNemar's test to statistically validate performance drops caused by these rephrasing perturbations.\n*   Experiments revealed an average accuracy degradation of 2.15% across 26 LLMs when evaluated on rephrased MMLU benchmark prompts (using µ=1.0 and DeepSeek 3 for rephrasing).\n*   Larger models and those with higher initial benchmark accuracy showed a greater tendency to overfit to prompt phrasing.\n*   The approach addresses a gap by detecting overfitting to benchmark-specific artifacts, which prior methods like n-gram overlap or embedding similarity miss, and can be integrated into training for improved robustness.",
