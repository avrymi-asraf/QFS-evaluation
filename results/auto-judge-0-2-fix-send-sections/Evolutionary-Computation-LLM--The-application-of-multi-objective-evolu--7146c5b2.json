SUMMARY:\nThis survey highlights the significant application of multi-objective evolutionary principles in research that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). A key area where multi-objective optimization is applied is in EA-based prompt engineering for LLMs. Here, EAs, particularly multi-objective variants like NSGA-II, are used to optimize prompts not just for performance but also for other objectives like instruction length or sentiment balance. This allows for the discovery of a Pareto front of effective prompts. In Neural Architecture Search (NAS), multi-objective EAs are employed to simultaneously optimize multiple criteria, such as model performance (e.g., perplexity) and efficiency (e.g., latency, size), leading to the discovery of optimal LLM architectures. Furthermore, in applications like software project planning, multi-objective EAs are used to optimize example selection for few-shot learning with LLMs, balancing accuracy and complexity. The research demonstrates that multi-objective evolutionary principles are fundamental to achieving a nuanced and balanced optimization when combining the capabilities of LLMs and EAs across various complex tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Multi-objective evolutionary principles are extensively applied in EA-based prompt engineering for LLMs, optimizing prompts for multiple criteria beyond just performance.\n*   In Neural Architecture Search (NAS), multi-objective EAs are crucial for discovering LLM architectures that balance performance with efficiency metrics like latency and size.\n*   The application of multi-objective optimization extends to areas like software project planning, where it's used to optimize example selection for LLM few-shot learning, balancing accuracy and complexity.\n*   These multi-objective approaches enable the discovery of Pareto fronts, offering a range of optimal trade-offs for complex problems involving LLMs and EAs.\n*   The synergy between LLMs and EAs, guided by multi-objective principles, facilitates more sophisticated and balanced optimization in diverse research areas.",

SUMMARY:\nThe surveyed research extensively details the application of multi-objective evolutionary principles across various domains where Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) intersect. In EA-based prompt engineering, multi-objective optimization is employed to refine prompts based on criteria beyond mere performance, such as instruction length and perplexity, as exemplified by the InstOptima framework. Similarly, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) frequently leverages multi-objective EAs to balance competing goals like model performance and latency, with methods like LiteTransformerSearch explicitly targeting Pareto frontiers. In software project planning, multi-objective EAs, such as NSGA-II in the SBSE approach, are used to optimize example selection for LLM-based estimation by considering error metrics and confidence intervals. Furthermore, the Quality-Diversity through AI Feedback (QDAIF) algorithm utilizes LLMs for evaluating solution quality and diversity, a key aspect of its application. The decomposition-based MOEA framework is also highlighted for its integration of LLMs as search operators in multi-objective optimization tasks.\n\n2.

In EA-based prompt engineering, multi-objective optimization is employed to refine prompts considering criteria beyond just performance, as seen in the InstOptima framework which uses NSGA-II to balance multiple objectives. For Neural Architecture Search (NAS), multi-objective EAs are utilized to discover architectures that optimize performance and other factors like latency. Similarly, in Software Project Planning, the Search-Based Optimization (SBSE) approach, specifically NSGA-II, is used to optimize example selection for LLM-based estimation, balancing objectives like error and confidence interval. The survey also notes the integration of LLMs into decomposition-based MOEA frameworks for multi-objective optimization. Furthermore, LLMs are used for evaluation in Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms like QDAIF, where they assess solution quality and diversity, enabling more complex qualitative domains to be explored.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Multi-objective evolutionary principles are applied in EA-based prompt engineering, with frameworks like InstOptima using NSGA-II to optimize prompts based on multiple criteria beyond performance.\n*   Neural Architecture Search (NAS) leverages multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to simultaneously optimize architecture performance and other factors like latency.\n*   In Software Project Planning, NSGA-II is applied within a Search-Based Optimization (SBSE) framework to optimize LLM prompt example selection by balancing multiple objectives.\n*   LLMs are integrated into decomposition-based MOEA frameworks to enhance multi-objective optimization processes.\n*   LLMs play a role in evaluating solutions within Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms, such as QDAIF, allowing for exploration in complex qualitative domains.",

In EA-based prompt engineering, multi-objective optimization is employed to balance multiple criteria beyond mere performance, as seen in the InstOptima framework which uses NSGA-II for optimizing prompts based on objectives like instruction length and perplexity. Similarly, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) leverages multi-objective EAs to balance competing goals like accuracy and latency, with methods like LiteTransformerSearch explicitly optimizing for perplexity and latency. Software Project Planning also utilizes multi-objective optimization, with the SBSE approach employing NSGA-II to optimize example selection for LLM-based story point estimation based on error sum, confidence interval, and number of examples. Furthermore, the Decomposition-based MOEA framework integrates LLMs to generate offspring individuals for subproblems in multi-objective optimization, while the QDAIF algorithm uses LLMs for evaluating solution quality and diversity.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Multi-objective evolutionary principles are applied in EA-based prompt engineering (e.g., InstOptima) and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to balance multiple objectives like performance, latency, and instruction quality.\n*   The SBSE approach in Software Project Planning uses NSGA-II for multi-objective optimization of example selection for LLM-based tasks.\n*   Decomposition-based MOEA frameworks integrate LLMs for multi-objective optimization by generating offspring for subproblems.\n*   The QDAIF algorithm utilizes LLMs for evaluating solution quality and diversity in a Quality-Diversity context.\n*   LiteTransformerSearch exemplifies NAS that balances objectives like perplexity and latency using EAs.",

SUMMARY:\nThe surveyed research extensively details the application of multi-objective evolutionary principles in the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). In EA-based prompt engineering, multi-objective criteria beyond mere performance, such as instruction length and perplexity, are considered. The InstOptima framework, for instance, utilizes NSGA-II to optimize prompts based on multiple objectives. Similarly, in Neural Architecture Search (NAS), EAs are employed to balance objectives like accuracy and latency, with specific algorithms like MO-MFEA being used for multi-objective multi-task NAS. Software Project Planning also leverages multi-objective optimization, with SBSE and NSGA-II being applied to optimize example selection criteria. The QDAIF algorithm exemplifies LLM's role in evaluating both quality and diversity. Furthermore, LLMs are integrated into decomposition-based MOEA frameworks for subproblem optimization, and challenges in LLM-assisted complex optimization, such as context limitations and interpretability, are identified. Robust prompt engineering aims to improve initialization strategies, while theoretical studies focus on algorithm analysis for methods combining LLMs and EAs.\n\n2.

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThe surveyed research extensively details the application of multi-objective evolutionary principles in the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). In EA-based prompt engineering, multi-objective optimization is employed to refine prompts, considering criteria beyond just performance, as seen in the InstOptima framework which uses NSGA-II to optimize for multiple objectives. Similarly, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) leverages multi-objective EAs to balance competing goals like accuracy and latency. Software Project Planning also utilizes multi-objective optimization, with SBSE and NSGA-II being applied to optimize example selection based on criteria such as error and confidence. The Quality-Diversity through AI Feedback (QDAIF) algorithm uses LLMs for evaluating the quality and diversity of solutions, a key aspect of Quality-Diversity. Decomposition-based MOEA frameworks integrate LLMs for optimizing subproblems. Challenges in LLM-assisted optimization, particularly for complex and large-scale problems, highlight the need for robust and stable prompt engineering, including improved initialization strategies. Theoretical studies are also crucial for analyzing the convergence and complexity of LLM+EA methods.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Multi-objective evolutionary principles are applied in EA-based prompt engineering (e.g., InstOptima using NSGA-II) and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to balance competing objectives like accuracy and latency.\n*   Software Project Planning utilizes multi-objective optimization (SBSE with NSGA-II) for example selection based on criteria beyond performance.\n*   LLMs are integrated into decomposition-based MOEA frameworks for subproblem optimization and are used by QDAIF for quality/diversity evaluation.\n*   Challenges in LLM-assisted optimization for complex problems necessitate robust prompt engineering, including better initialization strategies.\n*   Theoretical analysis of LLM+EA methods, focusing on algorithm convergence and complexity, is identified as a crucial future research direction.",

SUMMARY:\nThe application of multi-objective evolutionary principles is evident across several key areas where Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are integrated. In EA-based Prompt Engineering, multi-objective optimization is employed to refine prompts based on criteria beyond just performance, such as instruction length and perplexity, as seen in the InstOptima framework which utilizes NSGA-II. Similarly, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) leverages EAs to balance multiple objectives, including accuracy and latency, with methods like LiteTransformerSearch explicitly defining these balanced objectives. Software Project Planning also benefits from multi-objective optimization, with Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) and NSGA-II being applied to optimize example selection for LLM-based estimation. Furthermore, the decomposition-based MOEA framework integrates LLMs for subproblem optimization in multi-objective scenarios. In Quality-Diversity (QD) contexts, LLMs are used to evaluate both the quality and diversity of solutions, as demonstrated by the QDAIF algorithm. Theoretical studies are also crucial, focusing on algorithm analysis to understand convergence and complexity, while challenges in LLM-assisted complex optimization and the need for robust prompt engineering with improved initialization strategies remain active research areas.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Multi-objective optimization is a core application of EAs in prompt engineering (e.g., InstOptima considering multiple criteria) and Neural Architecture Search (e.g., LiteTransformerSearch balancing accuracy and latency).\n*   LLMs are integrated into multi-objective optimization frameworks like decomposition-based MOEAs for subproblem optimization and used for evaluating quality and diversity in Quality-Diversity algorithms (e.g., QDAIF).\n*   Software Project Planning utilizes SBSE with NSGA-II for multi-objective optimization of example selection for LLM-based estimation.\n*   Theoretical analysis of LLM+EA methods, focusing on algorithm properties like convergence and complexity, is highlighted as a future direction.\n*   Challenges remain in LLM-assisted complex optimization and robust prompt engineering, particularly concerning initialization strategies.",

In EA-based prompt engineering, multi-objective criteria beyond simple performance, such as instruction length and perplexity, are considered. The InstOptima framework, for instance, utilizes NSGA-II to optimize prompts against multiple objectives. Similarly, in Neural Architecture Search (NAS), EAs are employed to balance multiple objectives like accuracy and latency, as seen with LiteTransformerSearch. Software Project Planning also benefits from multi-objective optimization, with SBSE and NSGA-II used to optimize example selection for LLM-based estimation. The Quality-Diversity (QD) paradigm, including the QDAIF algorithm, leverages LLMs for evaluating solution quality and diversity. The paper also discusses challenges in LLM-assisted complex optimization, the need for robust prompt engineering with better initialization strategies, and the importance of theoretical studies for analyzing LLM+EA methods, particularly their convergence and complexity.\n\n2.

In the context of LLM-enhanced Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), multi-objective optimization is specifically highlighted in the study of multi-objective EAs (MOEAs), where LLMs are employed as black-box search operators to generate offspring for subproblems. The Quality-Diversity through AI Feedback (QDAIF) algorithm is noted for using LLMs to evaluate both the quality and diversity of solutions, enabling optimization in complex qualitative domains. Furthermore, the InstOptima framework utilizes NSGA-II for multi-objective prompt optimization, considering objectives beyond mere performance, such as instruction length and perplexity. In EA-enhanced LLMs, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) frequently employs multi-objective EAs to balance conflicting objectives like accuracy and latency. For instance, LiteTransformerSearch balances perplexity, latency, and memory. Software Project Planning also sees multi-objective optimization, with SBSE and NSGA-II being applied to optimize example selection for LLM few-shot learning, considering error, confidence interval, and the number of examples. Theoretical studies are proposed to analyze the convergence and complexity of specific LLM+EA methods.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Multi-objective evolutionary principles are applied across various LLM research areas, including MOEAs, NAS, and software project planning.\n*   LLMs are integrated into MOEA frameworks to optimize subproblems, and in Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms like QDAIF to evaluate solution quality and diversity.\n*   Prompt engineering, particularly in frameworks like InstOptima, utilizes multi-objective optimization (e.g., NSGA-II) considering criteria beyond performance, such as instruction length.\n*   Neural Architecture Search (NAS) commonly employs multi-objective EAs to balance objectives like accuracy and latency, as seen in LiteTransformerSearch.\n*   Software Project Planning utilizes multi-objective optimization (SBSE with NSGA-II) for tasks like example selection for LLMs.",
