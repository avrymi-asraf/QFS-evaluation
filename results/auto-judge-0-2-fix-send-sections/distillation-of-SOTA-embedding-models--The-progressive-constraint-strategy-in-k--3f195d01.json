The core of this approach lies in progressively transferring knowledge from multiple large, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher embedding models to a smaller student model. This distillation process is guided by three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. These losses evolve from aligning specific vector representations to capturing broader semantic similarities and relative rankings between text pairs. To address the challenge of high dimensionality often associated with SOTA models, the framework incorporates Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to effectively reduce the student model's vector dimensionality. The resulting student model, Jasper (2B parameters), built upon the Stella embedding model, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, significantly outperforming other models in its parameter class. The multi-stage approach allows for a gradual and effective knowledge transfer, demonstrating a robust strategy for developing powerful yet compact embedding models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The proposed framework uses a multi-stage distillation process with three distinct loss functions (cosine loss, similarity loss, relative similarity distillation loss) to transfer knowledge from multiple large teacher models to a smaller student model.\n*   The strategy progresses from specific vector alignment (cosine loss) to broader semantic similarity (similarity loss) and then to relative ranking preservation (relative similarity distillation loss).\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model, addressing a key challenge in deploying large embedding models.\n*   The student model, Jasper (2B parameters), achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of this progressive distillation strategy.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2B parameter embedding model, created through a multi-stage knowledge distillation process from larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding models like NV-Embed-v2 and Stella. The core of this distillation strategy lies in three carefully designed loss functions that progressively constrain the student model. Cosine loss (Lcosine) aligns absolute text representations, similarity loss (Lsim) ensures consistent semantic matching between text pairs, and relative similarity distillation loss (Lresim) enforces relative ranking preferences. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from multiple teachers, with Stage 1 training only a fully connected layer (FC1) to map student outputs to teacher dimensions, while Stage 2 further trains the last three encoder layers. Stage 3 employs additional FC layers (FC2, FC3, FC4) for dimension reduction using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL), utilizing Lsim and Lresim. A self-distillation approach is also proposed for dimension reduction by using earlier stage outputs as teacher vectors. Stage 4 integrates multimodal capabilities by training a vision encoder using image-caption pairs, with caption embeddings serving as teacher vectors for image embeddings. Jasper achieves competitive performance against 7B models on the MTEB benchmark, outperforming smaller models. Limitations exist in the vision encoding, which is basic and could be improved with further multimodal training.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The distillation framework uses a progressive constraint strategy with three losses: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss to guide the student model.\n*   Stage 1 trains only the initial FC layer, while Stage 2 expands training to include the last three encoder layers of the student model for deeper knowledge transfer.\n*   Dimension reduction is achieved through multiple FC layers implementing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL), with a self-distillation method proposed using internal model outputs.\n*   Stage 4 focuses on multimodal alignment by training a vision encoder using image-caption pairs, with caption embeddings acting as teacher signals for image embeddings.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) demonstrates performance comparable to 7B models on the MTEB benchmark, significantly outperforming other models in its size class.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art performance by distilling knowledge from multiple larger teacher models. The core of their approach is a multi-stage distillation framework that progressively transfers knowledge using three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. Cosine loss aligns absolute text representations, similarity loss focuses on semantic matching between text pairs, and relative similarity loss leverages ranking preferences. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling from teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5), with Stage 1 training only a linear layer and Stage 2 fine-tuning the last three encoder layers. Stage 3 employs Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected (FC) layers for dimension reduction, using only similarity and relative similarity losses for the reduced dimensions. A novel self-distillation approach is proposed for dimension reduction, using earlier student model outputs as teachers. Stage 4 trains the vision encoder using image-caption pairs for multimodal capabilities. Jasper's performance on the MTEB benchmark is comparable to 7B parameter models, significantly outperforming other 2B parameter models. The discussion highlights limitations in vision encoding, suggesting future work on contrastive learning for improved multimodal alignment.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The progressive constraint strategy involves three losses: cosine loss (absolute similarity), similarity loss (text-pair semantic matching), and relative similarity distillation loss (ranking preferences).\n*   Stages 1 and 2 differ in parameter training: Stage 1 trains only an FC layer, while Stage 2 trains the FC layer and the last three encoder layers.\n*   Dimension reduction in Stage 3 uses MRL with multiple FC layers, applying similarity and relative similarity losses to the reduced dimensions.\n*   Jasper achieves comparable performance to 7B models on MTEB despite being a 2B parameter model.\n*   Limitations in vision encoding are acknowledged, with future work planned for enhanced multimodal alignment through contrastive learning.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces a novel multi-stage knowledge distillation framework, \"Jasper,\" designed to create smaller, efficient embedding models by distilling knowledge from multiple larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models. The framework employs three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. These losses progressively transfer knowledge from the teacher to the student model, moving from specific to broader constraints. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling representations using these losses, with Stage 2 training more student model parameters than Stage 1. Stage 3 addresses the high dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher embeddings by using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional FC layers for dimension reduction, utilizing only similarity-based losses. A self-distillation approach is also proposed for dimension reduction. Stage 4 further enhances the model by incorporating multimodal capabilities through image-caption training. Jasper, with 2 billion parameters, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, outperforming smaller models. The discussion highlights Jasper's instruction robustness but notes limitations in its vision encoding, suggesting future improvements.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a multi-stage distillation process with three distinct loss functions (cosine, similarity, relative similarity) to transfer knowledge from multiple teacher models to a smaller student model.\n*   Stages 1 and 2 differ in the scope of student model parameters trained, with Stage 2 training more layers than Stage 1.\n*   Dimension reduction is achieved in Stage 3 using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers, employing similarity-based losses.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of the distillation strategy.\n*   While instruction robust, the model's multimodal capabilities are basic, with significant room for improvement in vision encoding.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper proposes a multi-stage knowledge distillation framework to train a smaller embedding model (Jasper, 2B parameters) from multiple larger state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models. The core of this approach lies in three carefully designed loss functions that progressively constrain the student model. Initially, cosine loss aligns absolute text representations. This is followed by similarity loss, which focuses on semantic matching from a text-pair perspective, addressing the overfitting issues of cosine loss. The third loss, relative similarity distillation loss, leverages relative ranking information within batches to improve robustness.\n\nThe distillation process is staged: Stages 1 and 2 train the student model's parameters with these losses, with Stage 2 involving training more layers. Stage 3 then employs Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected (FC) layers for dimension reduction, switching to only similarity and relative similarity losses for the reduced dimensions. A self-distillation approach is also proposed for dimension reduction using earlier student model outputs. Stage 4 focuses on multimodal training by aligning image and text embeddings. On the MTEB benchmark, Jasper achieves performance comparable to 7B models, significantly outperforming other 2B models. A limitation is identified in the basic multimodal training, with potential for future improvements.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The distillation framework uses three progressive loss functions: cosine loss (absolute similarity), similarity loss (pair-wise semantic matching), and relative similarity distillation loss (ranking preferences) to train a student embedding model.\n*   Dimension reduction is achieved through Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) using additional FC layers, with a shift to similarity-based losses for these reduced dimensions.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to 7B models on the MTEB benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of the multi-stage distillation strategy.\n*   Stage 1 and 2 of distillation differ in the parameters trained, with Stage 2 training more layers of the student model.\n*   The multimodal training in Stage 4 is described as basic, with potential for future enhancements.",

The core of this approach lies in a progressive constraint strategy employing three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. Cosine loss aligns absolute text representations, similarity loss ensures consistent semantic matching between text pairs, and relative similarity loss leverages ranking preferences to improve robustness. Initially, stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from multiple teachers using these losses, with stage 1 training only a fully connected layer and stage 2 expanding to include the last three encoder layers. Stage 3 addresses the challenge of high dimensionality introduced by concatenating teacher outputs by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers for dimension reduction. In this stage, cosine loss is omitted, and only similarity and relative similarity losses are used for the reduced dimensions, while the full 12288-dimensional vectors continue to be trained with all three losses. A self-distillation approach is also proposed for dimension reduction, using earlier student model outputs as teachers. Stage 4 focuses on multimodal training, aligning image and text embeddings using self-distillation. The resulting Jasper model, with 2B parameters, achieves performance comparable to 7B models on the MTEB benchmark.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The distillation framework uses a progression of three loss functions: cosine loss (absolute representation alignment), similarity loss (text-pair semantic matching), and relative similarity loss (ranking preference).\n*   Stages 1 and 2 progressively train the student model using these losses, starting with only a fully connected layer (Stage 1) and then adding the last three encoder layers (Stage 2).\n*   Stage 3 employs Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional FC layers for dimension reduction, modifying the loss functions to exclude cosine loss for reduced dimensions.\n*   The Jasper model (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to 7B models on the MTEB benchmark.\n*   Stage 4 details multimodal training using image-caption pairs and self-distillation to align visual and textual embeddings.",

The framework distills knowledge from multiple large teacher models into a smaller student model named Jasper. This process utilizes three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute text representations), similarity loss (measuring semantic discrepancies from a text-pair perspective), and relative similarity distillation loss (leveraging relative ranking information). The progressive nature of these losses, moving from specific to broader constraints, is key. Jasper's training involves four stages: initial distillation (Stages 1 & 2) which trains different sets of parameters, dimension reduction using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) and FC layers (Stage 3) where cosine loss is omitted for reduced dimensions, and preliminary multimodal training (Stage 4). The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by Jasper's strong performance on the MTEB benchmark, achieving results comparable to much larger models despite its smaller parameter count. Limitations in vision encoding are noted, with future work planned for improvement.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The progressive constraint strategy employs cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss to transfer knowledge from teacher to student embedding models.\n*   Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from multiple teachers, with Stage 2 training more parameters (last three encoder layers) than Stage 1 (only FC layer).\n*   Dimension reduction in Stage 3 uses MRL and FC layers, omitting cosine loss for reduced dimensions while continuing to train the primary 12288-dimensional vectors with all losses.\n*   Stage 4 involves preliminary multimodal training using self-distillation to align visual and textual embeddings.\n*   Jasper, a 2B parameter model, achieves performance comparable to 7B models on the MTEB benchmark, demonstrating the efficacy of the distillation framework.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance by employing a novel multi-stage knowledge distillation framework. The core of this framework is a progressive constraint strategy implemented through three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. Cosine loss aligns absolute text representations, similarity loss addresses semantic discrepancies between text pairs, and relative similarity loss leverages relative ranking information. This strategy allows a smaller student model to distill knowledge from multiple larger teacher models. The process involves stages that progressively train different parameters and then employ Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for dimension reduction using fully connected layers. Notably, cosine loss is omitted in Stage 3 for reduced dimensions, with similarity and relative similarity losses being retained. Stage 4 further unlocks multimodal potential through self-distillation for aligning image and text embeddings. Jasper's performance on the MTEB benchmark is comparable to 7B parameter models, significantly outperforming other models in its parameter class.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A multi-stage distillation framework with three losses (cosine, similarity, relative similarity) is used to progressively constrain a student model to learn from multiple teacher models.\n*   Dimension reduction is achieved via Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) using fully connected layers, with cosine loss omitted for reduced dimensions in Stage 3.\n*   Stage 4 focuses on multimodal training using self-distillation to align image and text embeddings.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Jasper model, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance by distilling knowledge from multiple larger teacher embedding models. The core of this distillation process is a novel multi-stage framework with three carefully designed loss functions. The cosine loss initially aligns absolute text representations but can lead to overfitting. To address this, the similarity loss focuses on semantic matching from a text-pair perspective, ensuring relative consistency. The relative similarity distillation loss further refines this by leveraging relative ranking information within batches, using soft labels generated by teacher models to guide the student. This progressive constraint strategy, moving from specific to broader constraints, is crucial for effective knowledge transfer. The framework also incorporates Matryoshka Representation Learning for dimension reduction and a preliminary multimodal training stage. Jasper's performance on the MTEB benchmark is comparable to 7B parameter models, significantly outperforming other models in its size class.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The distillation framework uses a progression of three loss functions: cosine loss (absolute alignment, prone to overfitting), similarity loss (pair-wise semantic consistency), and relative similarity distillation loss (ranking preference, using soft labels).\n*   Stages 1 and 2 train different sets of parameters of the student model (initially only FC layers, then FC layers and last three encoder layers) to progressively distill knowledge.\n*   Dimension reduction is achieved using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected (FC) layers, where cosine loss is omitted in Stage 3 for reduced dimensions.\n*   Stage 4 involves multimodal training, primarily focusing on aligning visual encoders with textual embeddings through self-distillation, though this stage has limitations and room for improvement.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) demonstrates comparable performance to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, significantly outperforming other models under 2B parameters.",

The core of this approach lies in progressively transferring knowledge from multiple state-of-the-art teacher embedding models to a smaller student model. This distillation process utilizes three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. Cosine loss aligns absolute text representations, similarity loss ensures consistent semantic judgments between text pairs, and relative similarity loss leverages ranking preferences. The framework progresses through stages, with initial stages focusing on distilling from teachers using these losses and gradually training more student parameters. Stage 3 addresses the challenge of high vector dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher embeddings by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers, omitting cosine loss for reduced dimensions. Stage 4 integrates multimodal capabilities by training the vision encoder. Jasper achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of this progressive constraint strategy.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The distillation process employs a progression of three loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (consistent semantic judgments for text pairs), and relative similarity loss (leveraging ranking preferences).\n*   Stage 1 and Stage 2 differ in the parameters trained: Stage 1 trains only a fully connected layer, while Stage 2 also trains the last three encoder layers of the student model.\n*   Dimension reduction in Stage 3 uses Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers, omitting cosine loss for the reduced dimensions.\n*   Stage 4 focuses on multimodal training by training the vision encoder using self-distillation with image-caption pairs.\n*   Jasper, a 2B parameter model, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, developed through a novel multi-stage knowledge distillation framework. The core of this approach lies in progressively transferring knowledge from multiple state-of-the-art teacher embedding models to a smaller student model. This distillation process utilizes three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. Cosine loss aligns absolute text representations, similarity loss ensures consistent semantic judgments between text pairs, and relative similarity loss leverages ranking preferences. The framework progresses through stages, with initial stages focusing on distilling from teachers using these losses and gradually training more student parameters. Stage 3 addresses the challenge of high vector dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher embeddings by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers, omitting cosine loss for reduced dimensions. Stage 4 integrates multimodal capabilities by training the vision encoder. Jasper achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of this progressive constraint strategy.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The distillation process employs a progression of three loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (consistent semantic judgments for text pairs), and relative similarity loss (leveraging ranking preferences).\n*   Stage 1 and Stage 2 differ in the parameters trained: Stage 1 trains only a fully connected layer, while Stage 2 also trains the last three encoder layers of the student model.\n*   Dimension reduction in Stage 3 uses Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers, omitting cosine loss for the reduced dimensions.\n*   Stage 4 focuses on multimodal training by training the vision encoder using self-distillation with image-caption pairs.\n*   Jasper, a 2B parameter model, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark.",
