SUMMARY:\nThis paper addresses the geometric unidentifiability of representation spaces in Large Language Models (LLMs) by proposing and formalizing the concept of a \"causal inner product.\" The authors argue that while concepts are represented linearly as directions in LLM representation spaces (the \"linear representation hypothesis\"), the choice of inner product is crucial and not inherently identified by the training process. They demonstrate that a causal inner product, defined by orthogonality between causally separable concepts (like \"male\" vs. \"female\" and \"English\" vs. \"French\"), can unify different notions of linear representation: subspace, measurement, and intervention. By estimating this causal inner product using counterfactual word pairs and statistical assumptions, the paper shows it respects semantic structure and enables meaningful geometric operations like projection and steering. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these findings, showing that the causal inner product correctly aligns concept directions and allows for controlled manipulation of model behavior, resolving the ambiguity of geometric interpretations in representation spaces.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis\" by defining concepts via counterfactual pairs and shows these representations relate to measurement (unembedding space) and intervention (embedding space).\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, requiring orthogonal representations for causally separable concepts, which unifies embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   This causal inner product is estimated and shown to respect semantic structure, resolving geometric unidentifiability in LLM representation spaces.\n*   The estimated causal inner product enables meaningful geometric operations like projection and steering, allowing for controlled manipulation of LLM outputs.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper addresses the geometric unidentifiability of representation spaces in Large Language Models (LLMs) by proposing a solution rooted in imposing a causal structure. The core problem identified is that the learned representations are only identifiable up to an invertible affine transformation, meaning standard geometric notions like cosine similarity and projection are not inherently meaningful. To resolve this, the authors formalize the \"linear representation hypothesis\" using counterfactual pairs, defining \"unembedding representations\" (related to measurement) and \"embedding representations\" (related to intervention).\n\nThe key innovation is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" defined such that causally separable concepts are represented orthogonally. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations through a Riesz isomorphism, effectively resolving the unidentifiability issue. The paper provides a method to estimate this inner product, relying on an assumption about the independence of concept representations in causally separable concepts. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and demonstrate that the estimated causal inner product respects semantic structure, enabling meaningful geometric operations for interpretation and control, unlike the standard Euclidean inner product.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The geometric unidentifiability of LLM representation spaces stems from their invariance to affine transformations, making standard inner products and geometric notions unreliable.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, defined by orthogonality of causally separable concepts, which successfully unifies distinct notions of linear representations (unembedding/measurement and embedding/intervention) via a Riesz isomorphism.\n*   An explicit form for the causal inner product is derived, based on an assumption about the statistical independence of causally separable concepts in the representation space.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 confirm the existence of linear representations and demonstrate that the estimated causal inner product captures semantic structure, enabling meaningful geometric operations for model interpretation and control, unlike the Euclidean inner product.\n*   The methodology relies on counterfactual pairs of linguistic elements to define and validate these linear representations and the causal inner product.",

The authors formalize the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" proposing that concepts are represented as linear directions. They demonstrate that notions of linear representation in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces are linked to measurement and intervention, respectively. The core contribution is the concept of a \"causal inner product,\" defined such that causally separable concepts are orthogonal. This causal inner product, as shown by Theorem 3.2, unifies the embedding and unembedding representations through a Riesz isomorphism, effectively resolving the geometric unidentifiability problem caused by arbitrary affine transformations. Theorem 3.4 provides an explicit form for this inner product, derived under an assumption about the independence of concept representations in sampled words. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these findings, showing that the estimated causal inner product respects semantic structure and enables effective control and interpretation, unlike the standard Euclidean inner product.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis\" and shows that different notions of linear representation (measurement and intervention) can be unified.\n*   Geometric unidentifiability of representation spaces, arising from arbitrary affine transformations, is resolved by introducing a \"causal inner product\" where causally separable concepts are orthogonal.\n*   Theorem 3.2 establishes that this causal inner product, via a Riesz isomorphism, unifies embedding and unembedding representations, providing a consistent geometric framework.\n*   Theorem 3.4 offers an explicit form for the causal inner product, derived from an assumption about concept independence in word samples, which is validated empirically on LLaMA-2.\n*   Experiments confirm that the causal inner product captures semantic structure and is crucial for meaningful geometric operations like projection and steering, unlike the Euclidean inner product.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper addresses the challenge of geometric unidentifiability in language model representation spaces by introducing and formalizing the concept of a \"causal inner product.\" The authors propose that high-level concepts are represented linearly as directions within these spaces. They demonstrate that existing notions of linear representation, specifically \"unembedding representations\" (related to measurement) and \"embedding representations\" (related to intervention), can be unified through this causal inner product. This unification is achieved via a Riesz isomorphism, which maps unembedding representations to embedding representations under the causal inner product. The paper derives an explicit form for this causal inner product, relying on an assumption about the independence of concept representations for causally separable concepts. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and show that the estimated causal inner product correctly captures causal separability, unlike the standard Euclidean inner product. This framework allows for both interpretation (e.g., probing) and control (e.g., steering) of model behavior by leveraging these causally informed geometric structures.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes \"linear representation\" using counterfactual pairs and introduces a \"causal inner product\" to resolve geometric unidentifiability in representation spaces.\n*   A causal inner product unifies \"unembedding representations\" (measurement) and \"embedding representations\" (intervention) via a Riesz isomorphism, enabling consistent geometric operations.\n*   An explicit form for the causal inner product is derived based on an assumption of independence between causally separable concepts' representations.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate that the estimated causal inner product respects causal separability, unlike the Euclidean inner product, and supports both interpretation and control of model behavior.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper addresses the geometric unidentifiability of representation spaces in Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing and formalizing the concept of a \"causal inner product.\" The authors identify that standard training procedures do not uniquely determine the inner product, leading to ambiguity in geometric interpretations like cosine similarity and projection. They propose a causal inner product, defined by the property that causally separable concepts are represented as orthogonal vectors. This causal inner product is shown to unify different notions of linear representation (subspace, measurement, and intervention) through a Riesz isomorphism. The paper derives an explicit form for this inner product under a specific assumption about word sampling. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of linear representations, validate the causal inner product's ability to capture semantic structure (orthogonality for separable concepts), and show its utility in constructing representations for model interpretation and control, such as steering model behavior.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The geometric interpretation of LLM representation spaces is unidentifiable due to the invariance of training objectives to affine transformations of representations.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, where causally separable concepts are orthogonal, unifying subspace, measurement, and intervention notions of linear representation via a Riesz isomorphism.\n*   An explicit form for the causal inner product is derived, relying on an assumption about the independence of concept representations in randomly sampled words.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate that the estimated causal inner product captures semantic structure, showing orthogonality between causally separable concepts, unlike the Euclidean inner product in some cases.\n*   The causal inner product enables the construction of interpretable and controllable representations, demonstrated by steering model behavior and predicting concept presence.",

The authors formalize the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" suggesting high-level concepts are represented linearly as directions within these spaces. They define two types of linear representations: unembedding (output space) and embedding (input space), linking them to measurement and intervention capabilities, respectively. A core challenge identified is that representation spaces are unidentifiable up to affine transformations, meaning standard geometric notions like cosine similarity are not inherently meaningful. To resolve this, they introduce a \"causal inner product,\" defined such that causally separable concepts are orthogonal. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations via a Riesz isomorphism. The paper derives an explicit form for this inner product, relying on an assumption about the independence of concept representations in randomly sampled words. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and demonstrate that the causal inner product correctly captures semantic structure, enabling meaningful interpretation and control.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" proposing concepts are linear directions in representation spaces, and addresses the geometric unidentifiability of these spaces.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, where causally separable concepts are orthogonal, unifying embedding and unembedding representations through a Riesz isomorphism.\n*   An explicit form for the causal inner product is derived, using an assumption about concept independence in word samples, and validated on LLaMA-2.\n*   The causal inner product allows for meaningful geometric operations (like projection) on representation spaces, enabling concept-based interpretation and intervention.",

The authors formalize the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" which posits that high-level concepts are represented linearly within these spaces. They define two types of linear representations: \"unembedding\" (in the output space) and \"embedding\" (in the input space), connecting them to measurement and intervention respectively. The core problem identified is that the representation space is only identifiable up to an affine transformation, meaning standard geometric notions like cosine similarity and projection are not inherently meaningful. To resolve this, they introduce the concept of a \"causal inner product,\" defined such that causally separable concepts are orthogonal. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations through a Riesz isomorphism, effectively resolving the geometric unidentifiability. An explicit form for this causal inner product is derived under a statistical assumption about word representations. Experiments on LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of these linear representations and validate that the causal inner product respects semantic structure, enabling meaningful interpretation and control.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis\" and identifies geometric unidentifiability in language model representation spaces as a key challenge.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, defined by the property that causally separable concepts are represented orthogonally, which unifies embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   The causal inner product is derived via an explicit form based on statistical assumptions about word representations and validated experimentally on LLaMA-2.\n*   This causal structure and its associated inner product enable meaningful geometric operations for interpreting and controlling model behavior, resolving the unidentifiability problem.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper addresses the geometric unidentifiability of representation spaces in large language models (LLMs) by proposing a solution rooted in imposing a causal structure. The authors formalize the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" which posits that high-level concepts are represented linearly as directions within these spaces. They demonstrate that different notions of linear representation (subspace, measurement, intervention) can be unified by a \"causal inner product.\" This specific inner product is defined such that causally separable concepts are represented by orthogonal vectors. The paper derives an explicit form for this causal inner product, relying on an assumption about the independence of concept representations. Experiments on LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and show that the causal inner product effectively captures semantic structure and enables concept manipulation for interpretation and control, unlike the standard Euclidean inner product, which is shown to be unidentifiable under the model's affine transformation invariance.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis\" for LLMs, proposing that concepts are represented as linear directions in embedding and unembedding spaces.\n*   Geometric unidentifiability, arising from affine transformations of representation spaces, is resolved by introducing a \"causal inner product\" that enforces orthogonality for causally separable concepts.\n*   This causal inner product unifies different notions of linear representation (subspace, measurement, intervention) and is derived through an explicit formula based on assumptions about concept independence.\n*   Experiments on LLaMA-2 demonstrate that the causal inner product captures semantic structure and enables effective concept manipulation (interpretation and control), outperforming the Euclidean inner product.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper addresses the geometric unidentifiability of representation spaces in Large Language Models (LLMs) by proposing a solution rooted in imposing a causal structure. The authors formalize the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" which posits that high-level concepts are represented linearly within a model's representation space. They define two key notions of linear representation: \"unembedding representations\" in the output space, linked to measurement, and \"embedding representations\" in the input space, linked to intervention. A central challenge identified is the unidentifiability of the inner product, meaning standard geometric notions like cosine similarity are not inherently meaningful due to affine transformations in the representation space. To resolve this, they introduce the \"causal inner product,\" defined by the property that causally separable concepts are represented by orthogonal vectors. This causal inner product is shown to unify the embedding and unembedding representations via a Riesz isomorphism (Theorem 3.2). Furthermore, they derive an explicit form for this inner product (Theorem 3.4) based on an assumption about the independence of concept representations in causally separable pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and demonstrate that the causal inner product captures semantic structure, enabling effective interpretation and control.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes linear representations in LLMs using counterfactual pairs and demonstrates that these representations can be unified through a \"causal inner product.\"\n*   Geometric notions like similarity and projection are unidentifiable in LLM representation spaces due to affine transformation invariance, which the causal inner product aims to resolve.\n*   The causal inner product enforces orthogonality between representations of causally separable concepts, leading to a unified representation space where embedding and unembedding representations coincide.\n*   An explicit form for the causal inner product is derived, enabling empirical validation on LLaMA-2, showing it respects semantic structure and facilitates model interpretation and control.",

They define two key notions of linear representation: \"unembedding representations\" in the output space, linked to measurement, and \"embedding representations\" in the input space, linked to intervention. A central challenge identified is the unidentifiability of the inner product, meaning standard geometric notions like cosine similarity are not inherently meaningful due to affine transformations in the representation space. To resolve this, they introduce the \"causal inner product,\" defined by the property that causally separable concepts are represented by orthogonal vectors. This causal inner product is shown to unify the embedding and unembedding representations via a Riesz isomorphism (Theorem 3.2). Furthermore, they derive an explicit form for this inner product (Theorem 3.4) based on an assumption about the independence of concept representations in causally separable pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and demonstrate that the causal inner product captures semantic structure, enabling effective interpretation and control.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes linear representations in LLMs using counterfactual pairs and demonstrates that these representations can be unified through a \"causal inner product.\"\n*   Geometric notions like similarity and projection are unidentifiable in LLM representation spaces due to affine transformation invariance, which the causal inner product aims to resolve.\n*   The causal inner product enforces orthogonality between representations of causally separable concepts, leading to a unified representation space where embedding and unembedding representations coincide.\n*   An explicit form for the causal inner product is derived, enabling empirical validation on LLaMA-2, showing it respects semantic structure and facilitates model interpretation and control.",
