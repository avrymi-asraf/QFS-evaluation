Counterintuitively, the study finds that even \"spurious\" rewards—those with little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, format adherence)—can elicit significant performance gains. This effect is highly model-dependent, with Qwen models showing substantial improvements while other families like Llama and OLMo exhibit minimal gains or even degradation. The research hypothesizes that RLVR, especially with spurious rewards, works by surfacing and upweighting latent reasoning capabilities acquired during pretraining. For Qwen2.5-Math, a key observed behavior is \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid in problem-solving), which becomes significantly more prevalent and strongly correlates with improved accuracy after RLVR, even with spurious rewards. This suggests that superficial interventions can indeed elicit complex reasoning if they tap into pre-existing, beneficial patterns within the model.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Spurious rewards (random, incorrect labels, format adherence) can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models via RLVR, sometimes matching ground truth rewards.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; Qwen models benefit greatly, while Llama and OLMo models show little to no improvement.\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards appears to elicit and amplify pre-existing reasoning capabilities, such as \"code reasoning\" (using Python for problem-solving) in Qwen2.5-Math.\n*   Increased \"code reasoning\" frequency strongly correlates with improved accuracy in Qwen2.5-Math models after RLVR, even with uninformative reward signals.\n*   These findings suggest that superficial interventions can unlock complex reasoning by leveraging latent pre-trained abilities, but this phenomenon is specific to certain model architectures and pretraining data.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates how Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can elicit complex reasoning behaviors in language models, even when using \"spurious\" or weak reward signals (e.g., rewarding incorrect labels, random rewards, or specific formatting). The research highlights that while these weak signals can significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance on models like Qwen2.5-Math (achieving gains comparable to ground truth rewards), this effect is highly model-dependent. For instance, Qwen2.5-Math models demonstrate a notable increase in \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid problem-solving), from an initial 65% frequency to over 90% after RLVR, even with spurious rewards. This code reasoning behavior strongly correlates with improved accuracy. Conversely, other model families like Llama and OLMo show minimal or no gains with spurious rewards, suggesting that RLVR primarily surfaces pre-existing reasoning capabilities learned during pretraining. The study emphasizes the need to validate RLVR findings across diverse models rather than relying solely on Qwen-based experiments, as spurious interventions can easily yield significant performance improvements on Qwen models by leveraging their specific pre-existing reasoning strategies.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Weak and spurious reward signals (e.g., incorrect labels, random rewards) can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, often matching gains from ground truth rewards.\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards dramatically increases \"code reasoning\" (using Python for problem-solving) in Qwen2.5-Math-7B from 65% to over 90%, which strongly correlates with performance gains.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; these gains are observed in Qwen models but not in families like Llama or OLMo, indicating reliance on pre-existing model behaviors.\n*   Directly inducing code reasoning through prompting or specific rewards significantly boosts Qwen2.5-Math model performance, validating its role in spurious reward gains.\n*   Researchers should validate RLVR findings across diverse models, as conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models may not generalize due to their unique pre-existing reasoning capabilities.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates how Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can improve mathematical reasoning in language models, even with \"spurious\" or weak reward signals (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, or format adherence). The study found that for the Qwen2.5-Math models, RLVR with these weak signals can yield significant performance gains, often comparable to using ground truth rewards. This improvement is largely attributed to the models' pre-existing reasoning capabilities, particularly a tendency to use \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid problem-solving). For Qwen2.5-Math-7B, pre-RLVR code reasoning frequency was 65%, increasing to over 90% after RLVR with spurious rewards, strongly correlating with performance gains. However, these spurious rewards did not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, highlighting model dependency. The research suggests that RLVR might be eliciting latent reasoning representations learned during pre-training, and that the GRPO optimization algorithm's clipping bias can even create training signals from random rewards by favoring existing model behaviors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards (random, incorrect labels, format) significantly improves Qwen2.5-Math models' reasoning, achieving gains comparable to ground truth rewards.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit high pre-RLVR \"code reasoning\" (65% frequency), which increases to over 90% post-RLVR and strongly correlates with performance gains.\n*   Spurious rewards are model-dependent, showing significant gains on Qwen models but failing to generalize to Llama3 or OLMo2.\n*   The study hypothesizes that RLVR elicits latent reasoning representations from pre-training, with GRPO's clipping bias potentially creating signals from random rewards by favoring existing behaviors.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates how Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can elicit complex reasoning behaviors, even with \"spurious\" rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels, or format-based) that have little or no correlation with the correct answer. The study found that for Qwen2.5-Math models, RLVR significantly improves performance on mathematical reasoning tasks, with gains from spurious rewards often comparable to those from ground truth rewards. For instance, random rewards yielded a 21.4% absolute accuracy gain on MATH-500 for Qwen2.5-Math-7B. A key finding is that Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong pre-existing tendency towards \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for problem-solving), which is significantly amplified by RLVR, increasing its frequency from 65% to over 90%. This code reasoning behavior is strongly correlated with improved accuracy. Crucially, these gains from spurious rewards do not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, highlighting the importance of pre-training data and learned reasoning strategies. The paper suggests that RLVR, particularly with mechanisms like GRPO's clipping bias, may primarily surface and upweight these innate reasoning capabilities rather than teaching new ones.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models even with spurious rewards like random or incorrect labels, achieving gains comparable to ground truth rewards (e.g., +21.4% accuracy with random rewards for Qwen2.5-Math-7B).\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong pre-existing \"code reasoning\" behavior (using Python for problem-solving), which RLVR amplifies from 65% to over 90% frequency, strongly correlating with performance improvements.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards in RLVR is highly model-dependent; gains observed in Qwen models do not generalize to other families like Llama3 or OLMo2, indicating the influence of pre-training.\n*   The GRPO optimization mechanism, particularly its clipping bias, can create a training signal from random rewards by amplifying existing model behaviors, explaining why spurious rewards work for models with strong pre-existing reasoning patterns like Qwen2.5-Math.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness even with \"spurious\" reward signals, which have weak or no correlation with the correct answer. Surprisingly, for Qwen2.5-Math models, RLVR with random, format, or incorrect label rewards can lead to significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning tasks, often approaching gains from ground truth rewards. For instance, Qwen2.5-Math-7B saw gains of 21.4% (random), 13.8% (format), and 24.1% (incorrect label) on MATH-500. A key finding is that Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit strong \"code reasoning\" (using Python code to assist in solving problems) even without execution. RLVR, particularly with spurious rewards, significantly increases the frequency of this code reasoning (from 65% to over 90%), which is strongly correlated with improved accuracy. This suggests RLVR elicits latent reasoning capabilities from pre-training. However, these spurious rewards do not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, indicating a strong dependency on the model's pre-training data and learned behaviors. The paper hypothesizes that RLVR algorithms like GRPO, through mechanisms like clipping bias, can amplify these pre-existing reasoning strategies, even when the reward signal is noisy.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its surprising effectiveness even with \"spurious\" reward signals (e.g., random, incorrect labels, or format-based) for enhancing mathematical reasoning in certain language models. The research demonstrates that for Qwen2.5-Math models, these weak or flawed rewards can elicit significant performance gains, sometimes approaching those achieved with ground truth rewards. For instance, Qwen2.5-Math-7B saw gains of 21.4% (random reward) and 24.1% (incorrect label reward) on the MATH-500 benchmark. A key finding is that this phenomenon is highly model-dependent; spurious rewards largely fail to improve models like Llama3 or OLMo2. The study identifies \"code reasoning\"—using generated Python code to aid mathematical problem-solving—as a pre-existing behavior in Qwen2.5-Math models that RLVR effectively amplifies, increasing its frequency from 65% to over 90% even with spurious rewards. This amplification of code reasoning is shown to be causally linked to performance improvements. The research also explores the role of optimization algorithm mechanisms, like GRPO's clipping bias, in generating training signals from random rewards, suggesting that RLVR often surfaces latent capabilities from pre-training rather than teaching new ones.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Spurious rewards (random, incorrect labels, format) significantly improve Qwen2.5-Math models' reasoning, achieving gains comparable to ground truth rewards (e.g., 21.4% with random rewards for Qwen2.5-Math-7B).\n*   This effect is highly model-dependent, with Llama3 and OLMo2 models showing little to no improvement from spurious rewards.\n*   RLVR amplifies pre-existing \"code reasoning\" (using generated Python code) in Qwen2.5-Math models, increasing its frequency from 65% to over 90% and causally linking it to performance gains.\n*   The GRPO algorithm's clipping bias is hypothesized to create training signals from random rewards by favoring pre-existing model behaviors.\n*   Findings underscore that pre-training heavily influences RLVR outcomes, and observed benefits may not generalize across different model architectures.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can improve language model reasoning, even with \"spurious\" or flawed reward signals. The study finds that for Qwen2.5-Math models, RLVR can elicit significant performance gains (e.g., +21.4% with random rewards, +24.1% with incorrect labels) that rival ground truth rewards (+29.1%). This improvement is largely attributed to the models' pre-existing reasoning capabilities, particularly \"code reasoning\" (using Python code to solve math problems), which is significantly amplified by RLVR. Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit high initial code reasoning frequency (65%) which increases to over 90% after RLVR, strongly correlating with performance gains. This effect is highly model-dependent; other models like Llama and OLMo show minimal or no improvement with spurious rewards, suggesting that the pre-training data distribution plays a crucial role. The study also explores the mechanism of GRPO clipping bias as a potential source of training signals from random rewards.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards (random, incorrect labels, format) significantly improves Qwen2.5-Math model performance, approaching gains from ground truth rewards.\n*   These gains are largely driven by amplifying pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capabilities in Qwen2.5-Math models, increasing its frequency from 65% to over 90% post-RLVR.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, with Llama and OLMo models showing little to no improvement, indicating the importance of pre-training data.\n*   Explicitly inducing code reasoning through prompting or RL improves Qwen2.5-Math performance, supporting a causal link between code reasoning and performance gains.\n*   The GRPO optimization algorithm's clipping bias may provide a training signal from random rewards by favoring and amplifying existing model behaviors.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its surprising effectiveness, even with \"spurious\" or flawed reward signals, on certain language models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math. Counterintuitively, rewards that are random, incorrect, or merely follow a format can elicit significant improvements in mathematical reasoning for these models. For instance, Qwen2.5-Math-7B saw absolute accuracy gains of up to 27.1% with spurious rewards, rivaling the 29.1% from ground truth rewards. A key finding is that these gains are largely attributed to RLVR's ability to surface and amplify pre-existing reasoning capabilities within the model. Specifically, Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit \"code reasoning\" (using Python to aid mathematical thinking), which is strongly correlated with performance. RLVR, even with spurious rewards, significantly increases the frequency of this code reasoning (from 65% to over 90%), directly boosting accuracy. This effect is highly model-dependent, with other model families like Llama and OLMo showing minimal or no improvement with spurious rewards, suggesting their pre-training data lacked similar readily elicitable reasoning patterns. The study also explores the role of GRPO's clipping bias in generating training signals from random rewards, reinforcing pre-existing behaviors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in models like Qwen2.5-Math even with spurious rewards (random, incorrect, format-based), achieving gains comparable to ground truth rewards.\n*   These gains are largely driven by RLVR amplifying pre-existing \"code reasoning\" behaviors in Qwen2.5-Math models, increasing its frequency from 65% to over 90% and directly correlating with improved accuracy.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; Qwen models benefit greatly, while Llama and OLMo models show little to no improvement, indicating the crucial role of pre-training data and learned reasoning strategies.\n*   GRPO's clipping bias mechanism is hypothesized to be a key factor in generating usable training signals from random rewards by reinforcing existing model behaviors.",

The study demonstrates that even rewards with little to no correlation with the correct answer, such as random, format-based, or incorrect labels, can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in certain models, notably Qwen2.5-Math. For Qwen2.5-Math-7B, these spurious rewards achieved performance gains comparable to ground truth rewards, with incorrect labels yielding a 24.1% absolute accuracy gain and random rewards a 21.4% gain on the MATH-500 benchmark. A key finding is that this effectiveness is highly model-dependent; other model families like Llama and OLMo showed minimal or no improvement with spurious rewards, suggesting that pre-training data and learned reasoning strategies play a crucial role. The research identifies \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid problem-solving) as a pre-existing capability in Qwen2.5-Math models that RLVR, even with spurious rewards, amplifies, leading to increased accuracy.

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness, particularly when using \"spurious\" or weak reward signals. Counterintuitively, the study finds that for specific models like Qwen2.5-Math, RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance even with rewards that are random, incorrect, or merely follow a specific format (e.g., using `\\boxed{}`). These gains, often comparable to using ground truth rewards, are attributed to RLVR's ability to elicit and amplify pre-existing reasoning capabilities within the model. A key observation is the strong correlation between an increase in \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid problem-solving) and performance gains in Qwen2.5-Math models, with code reasoning frequency jumping from 65% to over 90% after RLVR, even with spurious rewards. This effect is not generalizable; other model families like Llama and OLMo show minimal or no improvement with spurious rewards, highlighting the crucial role of pre-training data and learned behaviors. The study suggests that RLVR might be surfacing latent reasoning representations rather than teaching new skills, and that the GRPO algorithm's clipping bias may play a role in amplifying these pre-existing patterns, even with random rewards.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in models like Qwen2.5-Math using weak or spurious reward signals (random, incorrect, format-based), achieving gains comparable to ground truth rewards.\n*   These performance gains are strongly linked to the amplification of pre-existing reasoning strategies, particularly \"code reasoning\" (using Python for problem-solving), which increases dramatically in Qwen2.5-Math models after RLVR.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; they work for Qwen2.5-Math but generally fail for other families like Llama and OLMo, indicating that pre-training data and learned behaviors are critical.\n*   The GRPO optimization algorithm's clipping bias is hypothesized to play a role in eliciting these gains from random rewards by amplifying existing high-probability behaviors, especially when those behaviors correlate with correctness.\n*   Directly inducing code reasoning through prompting or specific rewards also boosts Qwen2.5-Math performance, further supporting the idea that RLVR is leveraging existing capabilities.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness, particularly when using \"spurious\" or weak reward signals. Counterintuitively, the study finds that for specific models like Qwen2.5-Math, RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance even with rewards that are random, incorrect, or merely follow a specific format (e.g., using `\\boxed{}`). These gains, often comparable to using ground truth rewards, are attributed to RLVR's ability to elicit and amplify pre-existing reasoning capabilities within the model. A key observation is the strong correlation between an increase in \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid problem-solving) and performance gains in Qwen2.5-Math models, with code reasoning frequency jumping from 65% to over 90% after RLVR, even with spurious rewards. This effect is not generalizable; other model families like Llama and OLMo show minimal or no improvement with spurious rewards, highlighting the crucial role of pre-training data and learned behaviors. The study suggests that RLVR might be surfacing latent reasoning representations rather than teaching new skills, and that the GRPO algorithm's clipping bias may play a role in amplifying these pre-existing patterns, even with random rewards.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in models like Qwen2.5-Math using weak or spurious reward signals (random, incorrect, format-based), achieving gains comparable to ground truth rewards.\n*   These performance gains are strongly linked to the amplification of pre-existing reasoning strategies, particularly \"code reasoning\" (using Python for problem-solving), which increases dramatically in Qwen2.5-Math models after RLVR.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; they work for Qwen2.5-Math but generally fail for other families like Llama and OLMo, indicating that pre-training data and learned behaviors are critical.\n*   The GRPO optimization algorithm's clipping bias is hypothesized to play a role in eliciting these gains from random rewards by amplifying existing high-probability behaviors, especially when those behaviors correlate with correctness.\n*   Directly inducing code reasoning through prompting or specific rewards also boosts Qwen2.5-Math performance, further supporting the idea that RLVR is leveraging existing capabilities.",
