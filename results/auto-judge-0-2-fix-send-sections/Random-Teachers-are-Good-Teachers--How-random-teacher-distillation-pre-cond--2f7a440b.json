      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research explores how \"random teacher distillation\" pre-conditions a network for supervised training by isolating the implicit regularization effects inherent in the learning dynamics. Unlike traditional distillation that uses a trained teacher, this method employs a teacher model at random initialization, stripping it of any learned \"dark knowledge.\" The study reveals that even without explicit supervision or data augmentation, a student network trained to mimic this random teacher develops remarkably strong representations. These representations are shown to be data-dependent and transferable to other tasks. Crucially, the student network exhibits characteristics observed in the early stages of supervised training, such as containing sparse subnetworks (lottery tickets) and residing on the boundaries of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape. This suggests that label-independent optimization dynamics can effectively navigate the loss landscape, providing a form of pre-conditioning that mirrors early supervised learning phases without requiring any task-specific labels. The proximity of the student's initialization to the teacher's random initialization further amplifies this beneficial pre-conditioning effect.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Random teacher distillation, by using a randomly initialized teacher, isolates the implicit regularization from the learning dynamics itself, rather than relying on the teacher's \"dark knowledge.\"\n*   Students trained with random teachers develop data-dependent and transferable representations, outperforming their randomly initialized teachers.\n*   These student networks exhibit characteristics of early supervised training, including the presence of sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and proximity to linear basins in the supervised loss landscape.\n*   The process demonstrates that label-independent optimization dynamics can pre-condition networks by navigating the supervised loss landscape, effectively mimicking early supervised learning phases.\n*   Initializing the student close to the random teacher amplifies these beneficial pre-conditioning effects.",

SUMMARY:\nRandom teacher distillation, where a student network learns from a teacher network at random initialization, reveals that the learning dynamics themselves provide implicit regularization, pre-conditioning the student for supervised training even without labels or data augmentation. This process allows the student to discover sparse subnetworks, akin to \"lottery tickets,\" and position itself within linear basins of the supervised loss landscape. This early phase of learning, characterized by label-independent dynamics, is amplified when the student is initialized closely to the teacher, a phenomenon observed to be crucial for robustness to pruning. The resulting student checkpoints exhibit similar stability to SGD runs from early stages of supervised training, demonstrating that random teacher distillation can effectively navigate the loss landscape and explore favorable parameter regions without explicit supervision. This implies that the fundamental mechanisms enabling effective supervised learning can be initiated through self-distillation alone.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Random teacher distillation leverages implicit regularization from learning dynamics, pre-conditioning networks for supervised training without requiring labels or data augmentation.\n*   Student networks trained via random teacher distillation discover sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and reside on the edge of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, mimicking early supervised training.\n*   Initializing the student closely to the random teacher amplifies this pre-conditioning effect, leading to improved representation quality and robustness.\n*   These label-independent dynamics allow students to navigate towards favorable regions of the loss landscape, similar to what occurs in the initial phases of supervised learning.\n*   The student checkpoints exhibit linear mode connectivity, indicating they have converged to stable basins that are also accessible by supervised optimization.",

SUMMARY:\nRandom teacher distillation, a simplified self-distillation process using a randomly initialized teacher network, pre-conditions a student network for supervised training by exposing it to implicit regularization inherent in the learning dynamics. This process demonstrates that meaningful feature learning can occur even without \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or data augmentations. The student network, through this distillation, develops sparse subnetworks, akin to \"lottery tickets,\" and positions itself at the edge of linear basins within the supervised loss landscape. This early phase of learning, characterized by label-independent dynamics, allows the student to explore the loss landscape similarly to how supervised training progresses in its initial stages. The proximity of the student's initialization to the teacher's amplifies this pre-conditioning effect, suggesting that the teacher-student dynamics, even with random teachers, can mimic and prepare a network for the subsequent supervised learning phase by establishing beneficial parameter configurations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Random teacher distillation implicitly regularizes the student network, enabling it to learn features and navigate the loss landscape without explicit labels or a trained teacher.\n*   The student network develops sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and settles near the boundaries of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, mimicking early stages of supervised training.\n*   Initializing the student network closely to the random teacher amplifies the beneficial regularization effects, leading to a more pre-conditioned network for subsequent supervised tasks.\n*   These label-independent dynamics are crucial for understanding how neural networks learn features in the initial phases of training, even before supervised signals are fully utilized.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nRandom teacher distillation, a simplified self-distillation process using a randomly initialized teacher, pre-conditions a student network for supervised training by inducing implicit regularization. This process, even without \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or data augmentations, enables the student to learn meaningful, data-dependent, and transferable features. Crucially, the student checkpoints developed through this method exhibit characteristics mirroring the early stages of supervised training. Specifically, they contain sparse subnetworks (lottery tickets) and reside at the boundaries of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape. This suggests that label-independent optimization dynamics can effectively navigate the loss landscape, similar to how supervised training begins. The proximity of the student's initialization to the teacher's random initialization amplifies this beneficial pre-conditioning. This work highlights that the success of distillation and self-supervised learning can be partly attributed to these regularizing dynamics, which allow networks to explore the loss landscape without explicit supervision.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Random teacher distillation induces implicit regularization, allowing students to learn meaningful representations without relying on a trained teacher's \"dark knowledge\" or data augmentations.\n*   The student networks trained via random teacher distillation develop sparse subnetworks (lottery tickets) and reach the edges of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, mimicking early stages of supervised training.\n*   Label-independent optimization dynamics, as seen in random teacher distillation, can effectively pre-condition networks for supervised tasks by navigating the loss landscape.\n*   Initializing the student closely to the random teacher amplifies the beneficial regularization effects, leading to better pre-conditioning.",

SUMMARY:\nRandom teacher distillation, where a student network learns to mimic a randomly initialized teacher, pre-conditions the student for supervised training by inducing implicit regularization. This process reveals that label-independent optimization dynamics can explore the supervised loss landscape, mimicking the early stages of supervised training. Specifically, students trained with random teachers develop sparse subnetworks, akin to \"lottery tickets,\" and exhibit linear mode connectivity, meaning different training runs from the same student checkpoint converge to similar low-loss regions. This stability and structure are achieved without any explicit labels, suggesting that the core learning dynamics themselves, rather than specific task information or data augmentations, are responsible for this beneficial pre-conditioning. The proximity of the student's initialization to the random teacher further amplifies this effect, leading to more robust and transferable representations, even before supervised training begins.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Random teacher distillation induces implicit regularization, enabling students to learn meaningful features and structure without explicit labels.\n*   Students trained via random teacher distillation develop sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and exhibit linear mode connectivity, similar to early stages of supervised training.\n*   Label-independent optimization dynamics allow students to navigate the supervised loss landscape, pre-conditioning them for subsequent supervised tasks.\n*   Initializing the student close to the random teacher amplifies the beneficial regularization effects and leads to more stable learning.",

This process, devoid of explicit label information or data augmentation, surprisingly leads to significant improvements in the student's representation quality, as measured by linear probing accuracy. The student not only outperforms its random teacher but also develops characteristics observed in the early stages of supervised training. Specifically, student checkpoints exhibit sparse subnetworks, akin to \"lottery tickets,\" and reside near the boundaries of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape. This suggests that label-independent optimization dynamics can effectively explore aspects of the supervised loss landscape. Furthermore, initializing the student closely to the teacher amplifies this regularization effect, leading to more stable and better-performing representations. The learned features are also found to be data-dependent and transferable across different tasks, indicating that random teacher distillation captures meaningful, generalizable patterns from the data, even without explicit supervision.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nRandom teacher distillation pre-conditions a network for supervised training by leveraging implicit regularization within the gradient dynamics, even without any \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or data augmentations. The process involves a student network learning to mimic a randomly initialized teacher. This distillation surprisingly leads to improved representations, as measured by linear probing accuracy, and demonstrates data-dependent feature learning that transfers across tasks. Crucially, the student checkpoints developed through this process exhibit characteristics similar to early stages of supervised training. Specifically, they contain sparse subnetworks, akin to lottery tickets, and lie at the edge of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape. This suggests that label-independent optimization dynamics can indeed explore aspects of the supervised loss landscape, effectively pre-training the network to a state that mirrors the initial phase of supervised learning. The proximity of the student's initialization to the teacher's amplifies this beneficial pre-conditioning effect.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Random teacher distillation imparts implicit regularization, enabling feature learning without explicit labels or data augmentation.\n*   Student checkpoints from this process exhibit characteristics of early supervised training, including sparse subnetworks (lottery tickets) and proximity to linear basins in the supervised loss landscape.\n*   Initializing the student close to the random teacher amplifies these pre-conditioning effects, leading to better representation quality.\n*   The learned features are data-dependent and transferable to other tasks, indicating a meaningful form of unsupervised pre-training.\n*   These label-independent dynamics allow the student to navigate the supervised loss landscape, mimicking the initial phase of supervised optimization.",
