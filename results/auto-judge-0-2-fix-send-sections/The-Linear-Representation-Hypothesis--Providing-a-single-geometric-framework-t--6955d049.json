SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" which posits that high-level concepts in language models are represented as linear directions within their representation spaces. It bridges the gap between the informal subspace hypothesis (e.g., word2vec analogies) and practical techniques like linear probing and activation steering. The authors introduce counterfactual pairs to formally define linear representations in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces. They demonstrate that unembedding representations connect to measurement (linear probing), while embedding representations connect to intervention (activation steering). A crucial contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product\" which respects language structure by making causally separable concepts orthogonal. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for the construction of probes and steering vectors from counterfactual pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and the efficacy of the causal inner product in connecting interpretation (probing) and control (steering) mechanisms.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes the linear representation hypothesis by defining concepts via counterfactual pairs, linking subspace notions to linear probing (measurement) and activation steering (intervention).\n*   A novel \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which makes causally separable concepts orthogonal, unifying embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   This unified geometric framework allows for the construction of probes and steering vectors using counterfactual pairs.\n*   Empirical results with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of linear concept representations and validate the proposed geometric connections between interpretation and control.",

It defines linear representations in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces using counterfactual pairs. The core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product\" which, when applied to unembedding representations, yields embedding representations. This causal inner product is crucial for unifying these different notions of linear representation. Theorem 2.5 demonstrates that by adding the learned embedding representation to the model's input, one can predictably steer concepts (e.g., changing gender) without affecting causally separable concepts. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these theoretical connections, showing that the estimated causal inner product respects semantic separability and that concept directions derived from unembeddings can effectively act as probes and steering vectors.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper provides a unified geometric framework that formally connects the subspace hypothesis (e.g., word2vec analogies) with linear probing (measurement) and activation steering (intervention).\n*   A novel \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which is derived from the property that causally separable concepts should be represented orthogonally in the representation space.\n*   Theorem 3.2 shows that this causal inner product establishes a mapping between unembedding representations and embedding representations, unifying these two perspectives.\n*   Theorem 2.5 proves that interventions (adding embedding representations to model inputs) can steer specific concepts while leaving causally separable concepts unaffected.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 empirically validate the existence of linear representations, the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic separability, and the ability of derived concept directions to perform probing and steering.",

It introduces two formalizations: one in the output (unembedding) space, connecting to measurement (linear probing), and another in the input (embedding) space, connecting to intervention (activation steering). The core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product\" which unifies these two notions. This inner product is derived from the principle that causally separable concepts should be orthogonal. By defining this causal inner product, the paper demonstrates how unembedding representations can be mapped to embedding representations, thereby connecting linear probing to activation steering. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate that this causal inner product respects semantic structure, demonstrating that concept directions estimated via linear probing can indeed be used to steer model behavior, and that the standard Euclidean inner product is insufficient for capturing these semantic relationships.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper provides a unified geometric framework connecting the subspace hypothesis (via unembedding representations and linear probing) with intervention (via embedding representations and activation steering).\n*   A novel \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which formalizes the intuition that causally separable concepts should be orthogonal, and this inner product unifies unembedding and embedding representations.\n*   Theorem 2.5 demonstrates that adding an embedding representation (derived from the unembedding representation via the causal inner product) to a context's representation steers the model's output towards the target concept without affecting causally separable concepts.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 confirm that the estimated causal inner product captures semantic structure, validating that linear probing directions can be used for activation steering, and showing the Euclidean inner product's limitations.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper proposes a unified geometric framework to formally connect the subspace hypothesis (e.g., word2vec analogies) with practical techniques like linear probing and activation steering in Large Language Models (LLMs). It formalizes \"linear representation\" in two ways: as a subspace in the \"unembedding\" (output word) space, which connects to linear probing (measurement), and as a subspace in the \"embedding\" (input context) space, which connects to intervention (steering). The core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product.\" This inner product is defined such that causally separable concepts are orthogonal, a property crucial for unifying the embedding and unembedding representations via a Riesz isomorphism. This unification allows for the construction of intervention vectors from the more readily estimated unembedding representations. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of these linear representations, validate that the causal inner product respects semantic structure (orthogonality of separable concepts), and confirm that the derived concept directions function as both linear probes and intervention vectors, effectively controlling model behavior without affecting unrelated concepts. The paper argues that standard geometric notions like the Euclidean inner product are insufficient for capturing these semantic relationships.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes linear representations in both embedding (input) and unembedding (output) spaces, linking them to intervention and measurement, respectively.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which treats causally separable concepts as orthogonal, and this inner product unifies embedding and unembedding representations via a Riesz isomorphism.\n*   This unified framework enables the construction of intervention vectors from unembedding representations, facilitating controlled manipulation of LLM behavior.\n*   Empirical results on LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear concept representations, the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic orthogonality, and the utility of derived concept directions for both probing and steering.\n*   The study highlights the inadequacy of the Euclidean inner product for capturing semantic structure in LLM representations, emphasizing the importance of a semantically informed inner product.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" proposing that high-level concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) are represented as linear directions in their representation spaces. It establishes a geometric framework connecting the subspace hypothesis (like word2vec analogies) with practical techniques like linear probing and activation steering. The authors define two formalizations of linear representation: \"unembedding representations\" in the output space, which connect to linear probing (measurement), and \"embedding representations\" in the input space, which connect to model steering (intervention). A crucial contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" derived from the principle that causally separable concepts should be orthogonal. This specific inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, enabling the construction of intervention vectors from the more accessible unembedding representations. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations, the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic structure and enabling control, and demonstrate that the Euclidean inner product is insufficient for this purpose.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formally connects the subspace hypothesis (e.g., word2vec analogies) to linear probing (measurement) via \"unembedding representations\" and to activation steering (intervention) via \"embedding representations.\"\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, defined by the orthogonality of causally separable concepts, which mathematically unifies embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   This causal inner product allows for the construction of intervention vectors from unembedding representations, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical control methods.\n*   Empirical results with LLaMA-2 confirm the existence of linear concept representations and demonstrate the efficacy of the causal inner product in capturing semantic relationships and enabling model steering, showing the Euclidean inner product's inadequacy.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper provides a geometric framework that formally connects the subspace hypothesis of concept representation in LLMs with practical techniques like linear probing and activation steering. It defines \"linear representation\" in two ways: as a direction in the *unembedding space* (connecting to measurement/probing) and in the *embedding space* (connecting to intervention/steering). The core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which is designed such that causally separable concepts are orthogonal. This specific inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for the construction of steering vectors from concept directions identified in the unembedding space. The paper demonstrates empirically with LLaMA-2 that this causal inner product respects semantic structure and that concept directions derived from counterfactual pairs can indeed be used for both probing and steering, validating the proposed geometric framework. The work highlights the critical role of the inner product choice, showing that the standard Euclidean inner product often fails to capture semantic relationships, unlike the proposed causal inner product.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A formal geometric framework unifies the subspace hypothesis (e.g., word2vec analogies) with linear probing (measurement) and activation steering (intervention) through counterfactuals.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, where causally separable concepts are orthogonal, which mathematically unifies embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   Concept directions, identified in the unembedding space via counterfactuals, serve as effective linear probes and can be transformed into steering vectors to control model behavior.\n*   Empirical results with LLaMA-2 validate that the causal inner product captures semantic structure and that these linear representations enable both interpretation and control.\n*   The Euclidean inner product is shown to be insufficient for capturing semantic relationships, whereas the causal inner product demonstrates this capability.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper provides a unified geometric framework connecting the subspace hypothesis (e.g., word2vec analogies) with practical LLM interpretation and control techniques like linear probing and activation steering. It formalizes \"linear representation\" through counterfactual pairs in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces. The unembedding representation aligns with measurement (linear probing), while the embedding representation connects to intervention (activation steering). A crucial contribution is the definition of a \"causal inner product,\" which ensures that causally separable concepts are represented orthogonally. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations via a Riesz isomorphism, enabling the construction of intervention vectors from unembedding representations. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these connections, demonstrating that concept directions act as linear probes and can be used for controlled intervention, while also highlighting the limitations of the standard Euclidean inner product for capturing semantic structure.\n\n2.

It provides two formalizations: one for unembedding representations (connecting to measurement/probing) and one for embedding representations (connecting to intervention/steering). The core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which respects the causal separability of concepts (i.e., concepts that can vary independently are orthogonal in this space). This causal inner product unifies the unembedding and embedding representations, allowing the construction of intervention vectors from the more easily estimated unembedding representations. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate that concepts indeed form linear subspaces, that these directions act as probes and steering vectors, and that the causal inner product correctly captures semantic orthogonality between causally separable concepts, unlike the Euclidean inner product.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis\" by defining concepts as linear directions in both unembedding (input context) and embedding (output word) spaces.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which enforces orthogonality between representations of causally separable concepts, thereby unifying the unembedding and embedding representations.\n*   This causal inner product allows for the construction of intervention vectors (for model steering) from unembedding representations (which can be estimated via counterfactual word pairs), bridging the gap between subspace representations and practical control.\n*   Empirical results demonstrate that this causal inner product effectively captures semantic orthogonality between concepts, a property not generally held by the standard Euclidean inner product.",

It provides a unified geometric framework connecting the subspace hypothesis (like word2vec analogies) with practical techniques like linear probing and activation steering. The authors define linear representations in both \"unembedding\" (output word) and \"embedding\" (input context) spaces, linking them to measurement and intervention, respectively. A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which respects the semantic separability of concepts by making them orthogonal. This specific inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations through a Riesz isomorphism. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these theoretical connections, demonstrating that concepts are indeed represented linearly, the estimated causal inner product captures semantic structure by showing orthogonality between separable concepts, and these concept directions can be used for both probing and steering. The paper highlights the inadequacy of the standard Euclidean inner product for capturing these semantic relationships.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes linear representations in both \"unembedding\" (output) and \"embedding\" (input) spaces, connecting them to measurement (probing) and intervention (steering).\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which makes causally separable concepts orthogonal, thereby unifying embedding and unembedding representations via a Riesz isomorphism.\n*   Experiments confirm that concept directions act as linear probes (measurement) and can be used to steer model behavior (intervention).\n*   The Euclidean inner product is shown to be insufficient for capturing the semantic structure of these linear representations, while the causal inner product demonstrates strong alignment with semantic separability.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper provides a geometric framework that unifies the subspace hypothesis of linear representations (e.g., word2vec analogies) with practical techniques like linear probing and activation steering. It formalizes \"linear representation\" in two ways: as directions in the *unembedding* space (connecting to measurement/probing) and in the *embedding* space (connecting to intervention/steering). The core of the framework is the introduction of a *causal inner product*, which defines orthogonality between causally separable concepts. This specific inner product is shown to unify the embedding and unembedding representations through a Riesz isomorphism. The paper demonstrates empirically with LLaMA-2 that this causal inner product respects semantic structure, validates the existence of linear representations, and shows that these representations can indeed be used for probing and steering, unlike the standard Euclidean inner product which lacks semantic grounding.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes linear representations in both embedding (input context) and unembedding (output word) spaces, linking them to intervention and measurement, respectively.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, defining orthogonality for causally separable concepts, which mathematically unifies embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   This causal inner product is empirically validated to capture semantic relationships and is shown to be crucial for effective linear probing and intervention (steering).\n*   The standard Euclidean inner product is demonstrated to be semantically insufficient for language model representations, highlighting the necessity of the proposed causal inner product.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper provides a geometric framework that unifies the subspace hypothesis of linear representations (e.g., word2vec analogies) with practical techniques like linear probing and activation steering. It formalizes \"linear representation\" in two ways: as directions in the *unembedding* space (connecting to measurement/probing) and in the *embedding* space (connecting to intervention/steering). The core of the framework is the introduction of a *causal inner product*, which defines orthogonality between causally separable concepts. This specific inner product is shown to unify the embedding and unembedding representations through a Riesz isomorphism. The paper demonstrates empirically with LLaMA-2 that this causal inner product respects semantic structure, validates the existence of linear representations, and shows that these representations can indeed be used for probing and steering, unlike the standard Euclidean inner product which lacks semantic grounding.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes linear representations in both embedding (input context) and unembedding (output word) spaces, linking them to intervention and measurement, respectively.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, defining orthogonality for causally separable concepts, which mathematically unifies embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   This causal inner product is empirically validated to capture semantic relationships and is shown to be crucial for effective linear probing and intervention (steering).\n*   The standard Euclidean inner product is demonstrated to be semantically insufficient for language model representations, highlighting the necessity of the proposed causal inner product.",
