SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the implicit regularization induced by teacher-student learning dynamics in self-distillation, specifically focusing on the behavior when the teacher is initialized randomly. Counter-intuitively, even with a random teacher and no data augmentation, the student model exhibits significant improvements in representational quality, as measured by linear probing accuracy. The learned representations are data-dependent and transferable, but fail when trained on random inputs. Notably, student checkpoints from this process contain sparse subnetworks and reside at the edge of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape. This suggests that feature learning and navigation of the loss landscape can occur through implicit regularization inherent in gradient dynamics, independent of explicit label information. The study also reveals that initializing the student closely to the teacher amplifies this feature learning, pointing to an intriguing local property of the loss landscape characterized by an asymmetric valley.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students trained with randomly initialized teachers show significant improvements in representation quality over their teachers, even without \"dark knowledge\" or data augmentation.\n*   Learned representations are data-dependent and transferable, but training on random inputs leads to deterioration.\n*   Student checkpoints exhibit sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and are located at the boundary of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape.\n*   Initializing the student closely to the teacher amplifies representation learning, suggesting a beneficial \"locality\" effect in the loss landscape.\n*   The process demonstrates that implicit regularization in gradient dynamics can drive feature learning and navigate the loss landscape without requiring explicit labels.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the implicit regularization within teacher-student learning dynamics, particularly in self-distillation, by using teachers initialized randomly instead of trained ones. The core finding is that even without any learned \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or data augmentation, a student model can still learn meaningful representations by mimicking a random teacher. This learning process is amplified when the student is initialized closely to the random teacher, suggesting a beneficial locality effect in the loss landscape. The student models exhibit improved probing accuracy, learn data-dependent and transferable features, and even develop sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and reside near the boundaries of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape. This indicates that label-independent gradient dynamics can effectively explore the supervised loss landscape, mirroring early stages of supervised training without requiring explicit labels. The research highlights that the regularizing nature of these dynamics, rather than just teacher knowledge or data augmentation, is a significant contributor to the success of teacher-student frameworks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students trained with random teachers learn meaningful, data-dependent representations that improve probing accuracy over the teacher.\n*   Initializing the student closely to the random teacher amplifies the learning process, indicating a beneficial locality effect in the loss landscape.\n*   The student checkpoints exhibit characteristics of \"lottery tickets\" (sparse subnetworks) and are found near the borders of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, even without explicit supervised training.\n*   This phenomenon suggests that implicit regularization from gradient dynamics alone can drive feature learning and exploration of the loss landscape, similar to early stages of supervised training.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates the implicit regularization induced by teacher-student learning dynamics, specifically focusing on the loss landscape around random initializations. Counter-intuitively, the study demonstrates that students can learn meaningful representations even from random teachers without any \"dark knowledge\" or data augmentation. The effectiveness of this process is highly sensitive to the initial proximity between the student and teacher. When initialized closely (small locality parameter α), students significantly outperform their random teachers in terms of representation quality, as measured by linear probing. Visualizations of the loss and probing landscapes reveal an asymmetric valley structure near the random teacher, where the student converges to a local minimum with high probing accuracy. This phenomenon suggests that random teacher distillation can mimic early-stage supervised learning, finding sparse subnetworks (lottery tickets) and reaching the edge of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, all without explicit label supervision. The learned features are also shown to be data-dependent and transferable across tasks, further emphasizing the implicit regularization at play.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Initializing the student closely to a random teacher (small locality parameter α) significantly boosts representation learning performance compared to independent initializations.\n*   Visualizations reveal an asymmetric valley in the loss landscape around the random teacher, with the student converging to a local minimum exhibiting high probing accuracy.\n*   Students trained with random teachers develop sparse subnetworks (lottery tickets) and reach the border of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, similar to early stages of supervised training, but without using labels.\n*   The learned representations are data-dependent, improving with increased sample size, and demonstrate transferability across different tasks.",

Surprisingly, students distilling from random teachers exhibit significant improvements in representation quality, outperforming their teachers and even raw inputs. These learned features are data-dependent and transferable to other tasks. The study reveals that initializing the student closely to the teacher (low locality parameter α) amplifies this learning, leading to better performance. Visualizations of the loss landscape show that the student, even when initialized near the random teacher (which sits at a global loss minimum), finds a different local minimum with high probing accuracy. This local minimum is situated within an \"asymmetric valley\" where loss increases steeply in one direction from the teacher but gradually in another, aligning with improved generalization. Furthermore, student checkpoints obtained through this process develop sparse subnetworks, akin to lottery tickets, and exhibit linear mode connectivity, mirroring early-stage supervised learning dynamics without requiring any label information. This implies that the regularization inherent in gradient dynamics, rather than \"dark knowledge\" or data augmentation, is a key driver of representation learning in teacher-student setups.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Initializing students closely to random teachers (low locality parameter α) amplifies representation learning and improves performance.\n*   The loss landscape around a random teacher exhibits an \"asymmetric valley\" where initializing the student nearby leads to a local minimum with high probing accuracy, unlike the teacher's global minimum.\n*   Students trained with random teachers develop sparse subnetworks (lottery tickets) and demonstrate linear mode connectivity, mirroring early supervised learning stages without labels.\n*   Learned features from random teacher distillation are data-dependent and transferable across different tasks.\n*   Self-distillation's success can be attributed to the implicit regularization of learning dynamics, enabling navigation of the supervised loss landscape without explicit supervision.",

The core finding is that even without \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or data augmentation, students can learn meaningful representations from random teachers. This learning is amplified when the student is initialized closely to the teacher, a phenomenon visualized through loss and probing landscapes. The study reveals an \"asymmetric valley\" in the loss landscape near the random teacher, where initializing the student closely allows it to find a local minimum with high probing accuracy, a behavior linked to findings by He et al. (2019) on generalization. Furthermore, the learned representations are data-dependent and transferable across tasks, even exhibiting characteristics of \"lottery tickets\" found early in supervised training, suggesting label-independent optimization dynamics can explore the supervised loss landscape.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students distilling from random teachers learn data-dependent and transferable features, outperforming their teachers even without dark knowledge or data augmentation.\n*   Initializing the student closely to the random teacher amplifies learning, with performance remaining strong for a range of locality parameters (α), though independent initialization still yields improvement.\n*   Loss landscape visualizations reveal an asymmetric valley around the random teacher, where closely initialized students find local minima with high probing accuracy, aligning with theories on generalization from flatter regions.\n*   Student checkpoints from random teacher distillation exhibit \"lottery ticket\" properties and reside at the border of linear basins, mirroring early-phase supervised learning dynamics without needing label information.\n*   The implicit regularization in gradient dynamics of self-distillation, even with random teachers, is sufficient for significant feature learning and exploration of the supervised loss landscape.",

The core finding is that even without \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or data augmentation, a student model can learn meaningful representations by mimicking a random teacher. This learning is data-dependent and transferable across tasks. A key observation is the amplified learning when the student is initialized closely to the teacher, a phenomenon linked to the \"asymmetric valley\" property of the loss landscape, as described by He et al. (2019). Visualizations of the loss and probing landscapes reveal that the student, when initialized locally, converges to a different minimum than the teacher, even though the teacher itself represents a global loss minimum. This local minimum for the student coincides with a region of high probing accuracy. Furthermore, the student checkpoints exhibit properties similar to \"lottery tickets,\" showing robustness to pruning and suggesting that random teacher distillation captures early-phase supervised learning dynamics without needing explicit labels.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students distilling from random teachers learn data-dependent and transferable representations, outperforming their teachers and raw inputs in probing accuracy.\n*   Initializing the student closely to the random teacher significantly amplifies representation learning, a phenomenon linked to asymmetric valleys in the loss landscape.\n*   Visualizations show that locally initialized students converge to distinct minima with high probing accuracy, even though the random teacher is at a global loss minimum.\n*   Student checkpoints from random teacher distillation exhibit \"lottery ticket\" properties, demonstrating early-phase learning dynamics without label supervision.\n*   The learning process is amplified when the student is initialized closely to the teacher, suggesting the loss landscape has an asymmetric structure near random initializations.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper explores the implicit regularization effects of teacher-student learning dynamics in self-distillation, specifically using random initializations for the teacher. Contrary to expectations, students trained with random teachers demonstrate significant improvements in representation quality, outperforming their teachers and even raw input representations. These learned features are data-dependent and transferable across tasks, even when trained on random noise, suggesting meaningful feature learning occurs without explicit supervision or data augmentation. A key finding is the strong influence of \"local initialization,\" where initializing the student closely to the teacher amplifies this regularization. Visualizations of the loss landscape reveal an \"asymmetric valley\" around the random teacher, where initializing the student on the flatter side of this valley leads to better generalization, a phenomenon linked to prior work by He et al. (2019). Furthermore, these student checkpoints exhibit properties similar to \"lottery tickets\" found in early supervised training, indicating that label-independent optimization dynamics can indeed navigate the supervised loss landscape.\n\n2.

The study reveals that even without \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or data augmentations, a student model can learn meaningful representations and even outperform its randomly initialized teacher. A key finding is the significant impact of \"local initialization,\" where initializing the student closely to the teacher (low locality parameter α) consistently leads to better performance. Visualizations of the loss and probing landscapes demonstrate that while the teacher might reside at a global minimum, the student, especially when initialized locally, converges to a different local minimum within an \"asymmetric valley.\" This asymmetric valley structure, where loss increases gradually in one direction and steeply in another, is crucial. The flatter side of this valley, towards the student's converged point, is shown to be beneficial for generalization, aligning with prior work by He et al. (2019). The student's learned representations are also found to be data-dependent and transferable across tasks, and remarkably, they exhibit characteristics of \"lottery tickets\" (sparse subnetworks) and lie on the border of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, mirroring early phases of supervised training without requiring explicit labels.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students can learn meaningful, data-dependent, and transferable representations even from randomly initialized teachers, without relying on dark knowledge or data augmentations.\n*   Initializing the student closely to the teacher (low locality parameter α) significantly amplifies this learning, showing a consistent performance range for α up to around 0.6.\n*   The loss landscape around a random teacher exhibits \"asymmetric valleys,\" where initializing the student on the flatter side of this valley leads to better generalization, similar to findings by He et al. (2019).\n*   Student checkpoints trained with random teachers develop sparse subnetworks (lottery tickets) and reside near the boundaries of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, mimicking early supervised learning dynamics.\n*   Visualizations show that even though the random teacher is at a global loss minimum, the locally initialized student converges to a different local minimum within this asymmetric valley, which is associated with high probing accuracy.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper explores the implicit regularization induced by teacher-student learning dynamics in self-distillation, specifically using random initializations for the teacher. The core finding is that even without a trained teacher or data augmentation, a student model can learn meaningful representations that outperform its teacher. This learning is data-dependent and transferable across tasks, suggesting that the optimization dynamics themselves play a crucial role. Visualizations of the loss and probing landscapes reveal an asymmetric valley around the random teacher, where initializing the student closely (low locality parameter α) leads to better performance and generalization. This behavior aligns with findings in supervised learning, such as the early emergence of lottery tickets and linear mode connectivity, indicating that random teacher distillation can navigate the supervised loss landscape without explicit labels. The research highlights that the success of distillation frameworks can be partly attributed to these implicit regularization effects.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students distilling from random teachers learn data-dependent and transferable representations, outperforming their teachers.\n*   Initializing the student closely to the random teacher (low locality parameter α) amplifies learning and generalization.\n*   Loss landscape visualizations reveal an asymmetric valley around the random teacher, with flatter sides leading to better generalization.\n*   Random teacher distillation exhibits properties similar to early supervised training, like the emergence of sparse subnetworks (lottery tickets) and linear mode connectivity.\n*   The learning process relies on implicit regularization from gradient dynamics, independent of explicit label information or data augmentation.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the implicit regularization induced by teacher-student learning dynamics in self-distillation, specifically by using teachers initialized randomly. Contrary to expectations, students trained on these random teachers exhibit significant improvements in representation quality, as measured by linear probing accuracy, even surpassing their teachers. This learning occurs without relying on \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or data augmentations. The study reveals that initializing the student closely to the teacher (low locality parameter α) amplifies this implicit regularization. Visualizations of the loss and probing landscapes highlight an \"asymmetric valley\" structure around the random teacher, where initializing the student on the flatter side of this valley leads to better generalization, aligning with findings by He et al. (2019). Furthermore, student checkpoints derived from random teacher distillation exhibit properties akin to \"lottery tickets\" found in early supervised training, demonstrating that label-independent optimization dynamics can indeed navigate the supervised loss landscape and discover beneficial parameterizations, even without explicit task supervision. The learned features are also shown to be data-dependent and transferable across different tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students trained on random teachers significantly outperform their teachers in representational quality, demonstrating implicit regularization without dark knowledge or data augmentation.\n*   Initializing the student closely to the teacher (low locality parameter α) amplifies this learning, and a range of α values (0 to 0.6) show comparable performance, with even α=1 yielding improvements.\n*   The loss landscape around a random teacher exhibits an \"asymmetric valley,\" and initializing the student on the flatter side of this valley leads to better generalization, a phenomenon linked to prior work by He et al. (2019).\n*   Student checkpoints from random teacher distillation develop sparse subnetworks and reside near linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, mimicking early stages of supervised training without label information.\n*   Learned features are data-dependent, improving with sample size, and transferable to different tasks.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the implicit regularization induced by teacher-student learning dynamics in self-distillation, specifically by using teachers initialized randomly. Contrary to expectations, students trained on these random teachers exhibit significant improvements in representation quality, as measured by linear probing accuracy, even surpassing their teachers. This learning occurs without relying on \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or data augmentations. The study reveals that initializing the student closely to the teacher (low locality parameter α) amplifies this implicit regularization. Visualizations of the loss and probing landscapes highlight an \"asymmetric valley\" structure around the random teacher, where initializing the student on the flatter side of this valley leads to better generalization, aligning with findings by He et al. (2019). Furthermore, student checkpoints derived from random teacher distillation exhibit properties akin to \"lottery tickets\" found in early supervised training, demonstrating that label-independent optimization dynamics can indeed navigate the supervised loss landscape and discover beneficial parameterizations, even without explicit task supervision. The learned features are also shown to be data-dependent and transferable across different tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students trained on random teachers significantly outperform their teachers in representational quality, demonstrating implicit regularization without dark knowledge or data augmentation.\n*   Initializing the student closely to the teacher (low locality parameter α) amplifies this learning, and a range of α values (0 to 0.6) show comparable performance, with even α=1 yielding improvements.\n*   The loss landscape around a random teacher exhibits an \"asymmetric valley,\" and initializing the student on the flatter side of this valley leads to better generalization, a phenomenon linked to prior work by He et al. (2019).\n*   Student checkpoints from random teacher distillation develop sparse subnetworks and reside near linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, mimicking early stages of supervised training without label information.\n*   Learned features are data-dependent, improving with sample size, and transferable to different tasks.",
