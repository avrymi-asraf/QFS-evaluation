SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces a novel multi-stage knowledge distillation framework designed to fuse knowledge from multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher embedding models into a smaller student model. The core challenge addressed is the impracticality of deploying large, high-dimensional embedding models in real-world scenarios. The proposed methodology leverages three distinct loss functions – cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss – to progressively transfer knowledge from teachers to the student. These losses are designed to capture both absolute and relative semantic similarities between the models' embeddings. To handle the concatenated high dimensionality resulting from multiple teachers, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed for effective dimension reduction. The framework also incorporates a stage for unlocking multimodal potential by aligning visual and textual embeddings through self-distillation. This multi-stage distillation approach, exemplified by the Jasper model, successfully creates a compact yet high-performing embedding model, achieving performance comparable to much larger models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A multi-stage distillation framework uses three loss functions (cosine, similarity, relative similarity) to transfer knowledge from multiple large teacher embedding models to a smaller student model.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model after fusing information from multiple teachers.\n*   The framework enables a smaller student model (2B parameters) to achieve performance comparable to much larger models (7B parameters) on benchmarks like MTEB.\n*   The distillation process does not require supervised data, allowing for the use of large amounts of unsupervised text.\n*   An additional stage for multimodal alignment is included, demonstrating the potential for integrating vision and text through self-distillation.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces a multi-stage knowledge distillation framework to train a smaller student embedding model, Jasper, from multiple larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from two specific teacher models, NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5. Stage 1 trains only a fully connected layer (FC1) to map the student's embeddings to the teachers' dimensions, while Stage 2 further trains the last three encoder layers of the student model. Stage 3 addresses the issue of high dimensionality arising from concatenating teacher vectors (4096 + 8192 = 12288 dimensions). It employs Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional FC layers (FC2, FC3, FC4) to generate lower-dimensional representations, using only similarity (Lsim) and relative similarity (Lresim) losses for the reduced dimensions. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal capabilities by using image-caption pairs for self-distillation, where caption embeddings act as teachers for image embeddings, aligning visual and textual modalities. The overall distillation process utilizes three carefully designed losses: cosine loss (Lcosine), similarity loss (Lsim), and relative similarity distillation loss (Lresim).\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Stages 1 & 2 involve training the student model with specific teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5), progressively training FC1 in Stage 1 and then the last three encoder layers in Stage 2.\n*   Stage 3 handles the concatenated teacher vectors (12288 dimensions) by using MRL with FC layers to reduce dimensionality, employing Lsim and Lresim losses for reduced dimensions.\n*   Stage 4 employs a self-distillation mechanism for multimodal training, using caption embeddings as teachers for image embeddings to align modalities.\n*   The teacher models utilized for distillation are NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5.\n*   The method combines teacher model outputs by concatenating their vectors and then reducing the dimensionality using MRL.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper presents Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, which effectively distills knowledge from multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher embedding models through a novel multi-stage distillation framework. Stages 1 and 2 focus on knowledge transfer from teachers NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5. In these stages, the student model's outputs are aligned with teacher outputs using three carefully designed losses: cosine loss (for absolute representation alignment), similarity loss (for text-pair semantic matching), and relative similarity distillation loss (for ranking preferences). The concatenation of teacher vectors leads to a high dimensionality (12,288), which is addressed in Stage 3 using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) via additional fully connected layers for dimension reduction. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential through a self-distillation mechanism, aligning image embeddings with text embeddings using the same three loss functions but without the cosine loss for reduced dimensions. The Jasper model, initialized from Stella and Siglip, achieves performance comparable to 7B models on the MTEB benchmark.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a multi-stage distillation process using three loss functions (cosine, similarity, relative similarity) to transfer knowledge from multiple teacher models (NV-Embed-v2, Stella_en_1.5B_v5).\n*   Stage 3 utilizes Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to reduce the concatenated high-dimensional teacher vectors into more manageable dimensions.\n*   Stage 4 incorporates a self-distillation mechanism to align image and text embeddings, using similar loss functions for multimodal learning.\n*   The Jasper model's architecture includes a language model encoder, a vision encoder, a pooler, and fully connected layers for output projection.\n*   Hyperparameters like λ1=10, λ2=200, λ3=20, and a margin of 0.015 were used during training, with distinct batch sizes and learning rates for each stage.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper presents a multi-stage knowledge distillation framework to create a smaller, efficient embedding model (Jasper) from multiple larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models. The methodology involves three carefully designed loss functions—cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss—to transfer knowledge from teachers to the student. Stages 1 and 2 focus on this distillation, with Stage 1 training only a fully connected layer (FC1) and Stage 2 additionally training the last three encoder layers of the student. Stage 3 addresses the challenge of high dimensionality arising from concatenating teacher vectors by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional FC layers (FC2, FC3, FC4) for dimension reduction, primarily using Lsim and Lresim. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential through self-distillation, aligning image embeddings with text embeddings using the FC layers from previous stages. Jasper, built on Stella, uses NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5 as teachers, achieving performance comparable to 7B models with only 2B parameters.\n\n2.

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper details a novel multi-stage knowledge distillation framework designed to fuse knowledge from heterogeneous, state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding models into a smaller student model, named Jasper. The methodology involves a progressive distillation process across four stages. Stages 1 and 2 focus on transferring knowledge from two SOTA teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5) using three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss for absolute representation alignment, similarity loss for text-pair semantic matching, and relative similarity distillation loss for ranking preferences. Initially, teacher model outputs are concatenated (resulting in a 12,288-dimensional vector), requiring a mapping layer. Stage 1 trains only this mapping layer (FC1), while Stage 2 trains FC1 and the last three encoder layers of the student model. Stage 3 addresses the high dimensionality by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected (FC) layers (FC2, FC3, FC4) for dimension reduction, utilizing only similarity and relative similarity losses for these reduced dimensions. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by using a self-distillation mechanism where text embeddings serve as teachers for image embeddings, aligning visual and textual representations. Jasper, built upon Stella, achieves competitive performance with 7B models despite its 2B parameters.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The framework uses a multi-stage distillation process with three loss functions (cosine, similarity, relative similarity) to transfer knowledge from multiple teacher models.\n*   Teacher model outputs are concatenated (12,288 dimensions) and then reduced using MRL-based FC layers in Stage 3.\n*   Stage 4 employs a self-distillation mechanism to align image and text embeddings, with text embeddings acting as teachers for image embeddings.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, outperforming other models in its size class.\n*   Teacher models used for distillation are NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper details a novel multi-stage knowledge distillation framework designed to fuse knowledge from heterogeneous, state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding models into a smaller student model, named Jasper. The methodology involves a progressive distillation process across four stages. Stages 1 and 2 focus on transferring knowledge from two SOTA teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5) using three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss for absolute representation alignment, similarity loss for text-pair semantic matching, and relative similarity distillation loss for ranking preferences. Initially, teacher model outputs are concatenated (resulting in a 12,288-dimensional vector), requiring a mapping layer. Stage 1 trains only this mapping layer (FC1), while Stage 2 trains FC1 and the last three encoder layers of the student model. Stage 3 addresses the high dimensionality by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected (FC) layers (FC2, FC3, FC4) for dimension reduction, utilizing only similarity and relative similarity losses for these reduced dimensions. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by using a self-distillation mechanism where text embeddings serve as teachers for image embeddings, aligning visual and textual representations. Jasper, built upon Stella, achieves competitive performance with 7B models despite its 2B parameters.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The framework uses a multi-stage distillation process with three loss functions (cosine, similarity, relative similarity) to transfer knowledge from multiple teacher models.\n*   Teacher model outputs are concatenated (12,288 dimensions) and then reduced using MRL-based FC layers in Stage 3.\n*   Stage 4 employs a self-distillation mechanism to align image and text embeddings, with text embeddings acting as teachers for image embeddings.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, outperforming other models in its size class.\n*   Teacher models used for distillation are NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5.",
