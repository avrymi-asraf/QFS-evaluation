SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to expose LLMs' overreliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. The core idea is to systematically distort benchmark prompts through parametric transformations while preserving semantic content and labels. This process reveals whether a model's high performance on standard benchmarks is due to memorized patterns or genuine comprehension. Their experiments, particularly on the MMLU benchmark with 26 leading LLMs, show that even modest rephrasing leads to significant performance degradation in most models. Crucially, the study highlights a paradox: models with higher baseline accuracy and larger parameter counts tend to exhibit greater performance drops under perturbation, suggesting they are more prone to overfitting on fixed prompt patterns. Conversely, models with lower baseline accuracy showed less degradation. This indicates that high benchmark scores might mask underlying fragility, urging the community to prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   High accuracy on standard benchmarks can be misleading, masking an LLM's overreliance on dataset-specific surface cues.\n*   The C-BOD framework detects this overfitting by rephrasing benchmark prompts, revealing performance drops when surface patterns are altered.\n*   A paradox exists: models with higher baseline accuracy and more parameters are more sensitive to prompt perturbations, indicating greater fragility.\n*   Models with lower baseline accuracy tend to be more robust to these prompt variations.\n*   The findings challenge the community to look beyond leaderboard scores and focus on LLM resilience and generalization.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a framework designed to address the paradox where high accuracy on benchmarks might indicate fragility in Large Language Models (LLMs). C-BOD works by systematically distorting benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic meaning and correct answers. By rephrasing inputs, it tests whether an LLM's performance relies on memorized patterns or genuine language understanding. The study applied C-BOD to 26 leading LLMs on the MMLU benchmark and found that most models exhibited a performance degradation when faced with these rephrased prompts. Notably, models with higher baseline accuracy and larger parameter counts tended to show greater performance drops, suggesting they are more prone to overfitting to dataset-specific surface cues. This highlights a critical issue in LLM evaluation: high scores on standard benchmarks may not translate to robust generalization. The authors advocate for looking beyond leaderboard scores and prioritizing resilience.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   High accuracy on benchmarks can be misleading, masking an LLM's overreliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding, indicating potential fragility.\n*   C-BOD, a novel meta-evaluation framework, detects this overfitting by rephrasing prompts while preserving semantic content, revealing performance degradation under such perturbations.\n*   Models with higher baseline accuracy and larger parameter counts tend to exhibit greater performance drops when tested with rephrased prompts, suggesting a correlation between scale/accuracy and overfitting.\n*   McNemar's test is used to statistically validate the performance differences observed between original and perturbed prompts, confirming the significance of the overfitting.\n*   C-BOD's primary limitation is its focus on textual rephrasing, potentially overlooking deeper forms of overfitting like factual inaccuracies or logical inconsistencies.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to expose how Large Language Models (LLMs) overfit to benchmark-specific surface cues rather than demonstrating true language understanding. C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts (like MMLU) by rephrasing them while preserving semantic content, then evaluates the LLM on both original and perturbed versions. A performance drop on the rephrased prompts, confirmed by McNemar's test for statistical significance, indicates overfitting. The study reveals a critical paradox: LLMs with higher baseline accuracy on standard benchmarks tend to exhibit larger performance degradations under these perturbations. This suggests that exceptional performance on public leaderboards may mask an overreliance on memorized patterns. The research also found that larger LLMs are generally more sensitive to rephrasing. The authors advocate for looking beyond leaderboard scores to prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation, noting that C-BOD can be integrated into training pipelines to mitigate this overfitting. However, C-BOD's current scope is limited to textual rephrasing and may not detect deeper forms of overfitting.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   High accuracy on standard benchmarks paradoxically correlates with greater performance degradation when prompts are rephrased, indicating overfitting to surface cues.\n*   The C-BOD framework detects this overfitting by measuring performance drops on semantically equivalent but textually distorted prompts, using McNemar's test for statistical significance.\n*   Larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to prompt rephrasing, exhibiting more significant performance declines.\n*   Overfitting is attributed to LLMs relying on memorized patterns, specific keywords, or question formats instead of genuine language understanding.\n*   C-BOD is limited to detecting surface-level textual overfitting and may not capture factual or logical inconsistencies.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify if Large Language Models (LLMs) are over-relying on dataset-specific surface cues rather than genuine language understanding. C-BOD works by systematically distorting benchmark prompts, preserving their semantic meaning and labels, and then measuring the performance difference. The study found that high accuracy on standard benchmarks can paradoxically indicate fragility. Models with higher baseline accuracy and larger parameter counts tended to exhibit greater performance degradation (an average of 2.15% across 26 leading LLMs) when exposed to these prompt rephrasings. This suggests that exceptional performance on benchmarks like MMLU may stem from memorizing specific prompt patterns, making these models susceptible to failure when faced with slight variations. The Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy showed more robustness. C-BOD utilizes McNemar's test for statistical validation, confirming that performance drops are not due to chance. The key finding is that high benchmark scores should be interpreted with caution, as they may mask an underlying over-reliance on superficial cues.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to uncover an LLM's reliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. C-BOD works by systematically distorting benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic content and labels. This process reveals how performance degrades under textual perturbations, indicating overfitting. The study found that higher baseline accuracy in LLMs often correlates with a larger performance drop when prompts are rephrased, presenting a paradox: models excelling on standard benchmarks may be more fragile and over-reliant on specific phrasing. Larger models also tend to be more sensitive to these rephrasings. Conversely, models like the Llama family showed less degradation, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues. On average, 20 out of 26 leading LLMs exhibited statistically significant performance degradation (an average drop of 2.15%) when subjected to modest prompt distortions, highlighting a widespread issue in LLM evaluation that prioritizes leaderboard scores over true robustness.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   High accuracy on standard benchmarks can paradoxically indicate LLM fragility, as these models may over-rely on superficial prompt patterns.\n*   LLMs with higher baseline accuracy and larger parameter counts tend to exhibit greater performance degradation when prompts are rephrased, revealing a sensitivity to prompt variations.\n*   The C-BOD framework systematically distorts prompts, quantifying performance drops and using McNemar's test for statistical significance to detect overfitting to benchmark-specific phrasing.\n*   The Llama family of models demonstrated greater robustness and less performance degradation under prompt perturbations, suggesting a reduced dependency on superficial cues compared to other models.\n*   An average performance drop of 2.15% was observed across 20 out of 26 evaluated LLMs when tested with perturbed prompts, highlighting a widespread issue of overfitting to dataset formats.",
