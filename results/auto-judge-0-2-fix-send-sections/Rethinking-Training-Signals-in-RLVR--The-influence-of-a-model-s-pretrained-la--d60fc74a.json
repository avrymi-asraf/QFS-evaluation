SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how a model's pre-trained latent abilities influence Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) outcomes, even when the reward signals are of low quality or entirely spurious. The study found that specific models, like Qwen2.5-Math, can achieve significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning tasks (e.g., MATH-500) using rewards that are random, incorrectly labeled, or merely based on output formatting. These gains are attributed to RLVR's ability to surface and amplify pre-existing reasoning strategies within the model, rather than teaching new ones. A notable example is \"code reasoning\" (using Python-like thinking without actual execution), which Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit frequently and which is further amplified by RLVR, leading to substantial accuracy improvements. Conversely, other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2 do not show similar gains with spurious rewards, indicating that the effectiveness of RLVR with weak signals is highly dependent on the model's pre-trained latent abilities. The paper emphasizes that future RLVR research should be validated across diverse models to avoid drawing conclusions based solely on models with strong pre-trained reasoning capabilities.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance even with spurious or incorrect reward signals, particularly in models like Qwen2.5-Math.\n*   These performance gains are primarily driven by RLVR eliciting and amplifying pre-existing latent abilities learned during pre-training, such as \"code reasoning.\"\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; Qwen2.5-Math models benefit significantly, while other families like Llama3 and OLMo2 show minimal or no gains.\n*   The study suggests that future RLVR research should be validated on a diverse range of models, not just those with strong pre-trained reasoning capabilities, to ensure generalizability.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates how pretrained latent abilities, specifically code reasoning, influence the outcomes of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), even when the reward signal is weak or spurious. The study found that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in certain models, like Qwen2.5-Math, even with rewards that are random, incorrect, or based on formatting, rather than ground truth. This improvement is largely attributed to RLVR's ability to elicit and upweight pre-existing reasoning strategies learned during pretraining. Notably, the Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong propensity for \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for mathematical thinking without execution), which becomes more frequent after RLVR and strongly correlates with performance gains. In contrast, other model families like Llama and OLMo show minimal or no improvement with spurious rewards, suggesting their pretrained latent abilities differ and are not as readily elicited by these signals. The research highlights that the effectiveness of RLVR is heavily dependent on the model's pretrained capabilities, and that spurious rewards can be surprisingly effective if they trigger these latent, beneficial behaviors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can elicit significant mathematical reasoning improvements in models like Qwen2.5-Math even with spurious rewards (random, incorrect, format-based), largely by leveraging pretrained latent abilities.\n*   The \"code reasoning\" capability, where models generate Python code for mathematical thinking, is a distinctive pretrained ability of Qwen2.5-Math models that is significantly upweighted by RLVR, correlating with performance gains.\n*   Other model families (Llama, OLMo) do not benefit from spurious rewards, indicating that their pretrained latent abilities are different and not as easily elicited by these signals.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR, particularly with weak or spurious rewards, is highly dependent on the specific latent reasoning strategies embedded in the model during pretraining.\n*   Researchers should validate RLVR findings on diverse models, as effects observed in one family (like Qwen) may not generalize due to differences in pretrained latent abilities.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness, even with flawed or \"spurious\" reward signals, particularly concerning the influence of pretrained latent abilities. The study found that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance in certain models, like Qwen2.5-Math, even when rewards are random, incorrect, or only based on output format. This is often achieved by surfacing and amplifying existing reasoning strategies learned during pretraining, rather than teaching new ones. A key observation is that \"code reasoning\" – using Python code within the generation process without actual execution – is a strong predictor of performance for Qwen2.5-Math models and becomes significantly more frequent after RLVR, even with spurious rewards. Crucially, these gains are highly model-dependent; other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2 do not benefit from spurious rewards, suggesting their distinct pretrained latent abilities. The findings imply that future RLVR research should be validated on diverse models and that the specific pretrained reasoning capabilities of a model play a critical role in its response to RLVR, irrespective of reward signal quality.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can yield significant performance gains in mathematical reasoning even with spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format-only), demonstrating that the quality of the reward signal is not the sole determinant of success.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is highly dependent on the model's pretrained latent abilities. Qwen2.5-Math models show substantial improvements, while other families like Llama3 and OLMo2 do not, highlighting model-specific priors.\n*   \"Code reasoning\" (generating Python code for reasoning without execution) is a distinct pretrained capability in Qwen2.5-Math models that is significantly amplified by RLVR, correlating strongly with performance improvements across various reward signals.\n*   The study suggests that RLVR primarily elicits and upweights existing reasoning patterns learned during pretraining, rather than teaching fundamentally new capabilities, especially when reward signals are weak or uninformative.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse model families to account for these latent ability differences and avoid drawing conclusions solely from models like Qwen2.5-Math.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research demonstrates that Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in certain language models, like Qwen2.5-Math, even when provided with weak or entirely spurious reward signals (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels). The study highlights that these spurious rewards can elicit strong performance gains, sometimes comparable to using ground truth rewards. Crucially, this effect is highly model-dependent; similar spurious rewards that benefit Qwen models often fail or even degrade performance on other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2. The key factor identified for Qwen2.5-Math models is their pre-existing \"code reasoning\" ability—generating Python code to assist in problem-solving without actual execution. RLVR, even with spurious signals, significantly increases the frequency of this code reasoning, leading to performance improvements. This suggests that RLVR primarily surfaces latent abilities learned during pretraining rather than teaching new ones. The findings imply that future RLVR research should be validated on diverse models and acknowledge the strong influence of a model's pretrained latent abilities.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve substantial performance gains in mathematical reasoning using weak or spurious reward signals, with Qwen2.5-Math models showing significant improvements even with random or incorrect rewards.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; Qwen2.5-Math models benefit greatly, while other families like Llama3 and OLMo2 show little to no improvement or even degradation.\n*   \"Code reasoning\"—the generation of Python code for problem-solving—is identified as a key latent ability in Qwen2.5-Math models that RLVR effectively elicits, leading to increased accuracy.\n*   RLVR likely works by surfacing and upweighting pre-existing reasoning strategies learned during pretraining, rather than teaching new capabilities, especially when reward signals are weak.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated across diverse model architectures to understand the role of pre-trained latent abilities and avoid conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models.",

Counterintuitively, the study demonstrates that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning capabilities in certain models, like Qwen2.5-Math, even with rewards that have little to no correlation with the correct answer. For instance, using random or incorrect labels yielded substantial accuracy gains, approaching those achieved with ground truth rewards. However, this effectiveness is highly model-dependent.

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness with spurious reward signals. The core finding is that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in certain models, like Qwen2.5-Math, even when the reward signal is weak, incorrect, or random. These spurious rewards can achieve performance gains comparable to ground truth rewards. However, this effectiveness is highly model-dependent; other model families, such as Llama3 and OLMo2, do not benefit from these spurious rewards and may even see performance degradation. The study identifies \"code reasoning\"—generating Python code to aid mathematical thinking without actual execution—as a distinctive and beneficial pre-trained ability of Qwen2.5-Math models. RLVR, particularly with spurious rewards, appears to amplify this existing code reasoning capability, leading to improved performance. This suggests that RLVR might primarily elicit latent abilities learned during pretraining rather than teaching new ones. The research also highlights that RLVR findings should be validated across diverse models, as Qwen models might be uniquely susceptible to improvements from weak signals, and underscores the need to understand the influence of pre-training on RLVR outcomes.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve significant performance gains in mathematical reasoning even with weak or spurious reward signals (e.g., random, incorrect labels).\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; Qwen2.5-Math models benefit greatly, while Llama3 and OLMo2 models do not.\n*   \"Code reasoning\" (generating Python code for thought processes) is a pre-trained ability that RLVR, especially with spurious rewards, amplifies, leading to improved performance in models like Qwen2.5-Math.\n*   This suggests RLVR may primarily elicit existing latent abilities from pretraining rather than teaching new skills.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse models, not just Qwen, due to the observed model-specific effectiveness of spurious rewards.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness with \"spurious\" reward signals—rewards that are weak, incorrect, or even random—on mathematical reasoning tasks. The core finding is that RLVR can elicit significant performance gains, even with these flawed rewards, but this effect is highly model-dependent. Specifically, the Qwen2.5-Math models demonstrate remarkable improvements with spurious rewards, often approaching the gains seen with ground truth rewards. This effectiveness is attributed to the models' pre-trained latent abilities, particularly their propensity for \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to assist in problem-solving without actual execution). RLVR appears to upweight this pre-existing capability, leading to performance boosts. In contrast, other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2 show little to no improvement with spurious rewards, suggesting their pre-training did not instill similar useful reasoning strategies. The study emphasizes that RLVR primarily surfaces existing model capabilities rather than teaching new ones and warns that conclusions drawn from Qwen models may not generalize, advocating for diverse model testing in future RLVR research.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve substantial performance gains in mathematical reasoning even with weak or spurious reward signals.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, with Qwen2.5-Math models showing significant improvements while Llama3 and OLMo2 models do not.\n*   \"Code reasoning\"—the generation of Python code for problem-solving—is identified as a key pre-trained latent ability that RLVR effectively upweights, leading to performance gains in Qwen2.5-Math models.\n*   RLVR is hypothesized to elicit existing latent reasoning abilities rather than teach new ones, explaining why spurious rewards can be effective.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse model families, not just Qwen models, due to the observed model-specific nature of spurious reward effectiveness.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its surprising effectiveness even with \"spurious\" or weak reward signals, demonstrating significant performance improvements on the Qwen2.5-Math model. The core finding is that RLVR, particularly with spurious rewards, appears to elicit and amplify latent reasoning abilities acquired during pretraining, rather than teaching new skills. This is exemplified by the Qwen2.5-Math model's increased \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for mathematical thought processes without execution), which significantly correlates with improved accuracy. Crucially, this effect is highly model-dependent; other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2 do not show similar gains with these spurious rewards, suggesting that the specific pretraining strategies of a model are paramount. The research highlights that spurious rewards can achieve gains comparable to ground truth rewards on Qwen models, leading to a call for more diverse model validation in RLVR research. The paper also explores the role of GRPO's clipping bias in enabling random rewards to provide training signals by exploiting existing model priors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve substantial performance gains even with weak or spurious reward signals, largely by eliciting pre-existing latent abilities.\n*   The \"code reasoning\" capability, prevalent in Qwen2.5-Math models, is significantly amplified by RLVR, correlating with improved accuracy.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, with Qwen models showing significant gains while others like Llama and OLMo do not.\n*   The findings suggest that pretraining heavily influences RLVR outcomes, and future research should validate methods on diverse models, not just Qwen.\n*   GRPO's clipping mechanism can create a training signal from random rewards by exploiting existing model priors, such as code reasoning.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research demonstrates that Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in certain models, like Qwen2.5-Math, even when trained with weak or entirely spurious reward signals (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels). These gains are substantial, sometimes approaching those achieved with ground truth rewards. Crucially, this effectiveness is highly model-dependent; spurious rewards that work for Qwen models often fail to benefit other families like Llama or OLMo. The study hypothesizes that RLVR, particularly when the reward signal is weak, leverages and amplifies latent reasoning abilities acquired during pretraining. A key identified ability in Qwen models is \"code reasoning\"—generating Python code to aid mathematical thought, even without execution. RLVR training demonstrably increases the frequency of this code reasoning, directly correlating with performance improvements. This suggests that RLVR's mechanism, especially with weak signals, is to elicit pre-existing, beneficial reasoning strategies rather than teaching new ones. The findings imply that future RLVR research should be validated across diverse models and that pretraining plays a critical role in downstream RLVR success.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve significant performance gains in mathematical reasoning even with spurious or weak reward signals, especially in Qwen2.5-Math models.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards in RLVR is highly model-dependent, with Qwen models showing strong benefits that do not generalize to other families like Llama or OLMo.\n*   Pretrained latent abilities, particularly \"code reasoning\" (generating Python for math), are a key factor enabling Qwen models to benefit from RLVR with weak rewards. RLVR amplifies this pre-existing capability.\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards appears to elicit and upweight existing beneficial reasoning strategies rather than teaching new ones.\n*   Future RLVR research necessitates validation on diverse model architectures to avoid overgeneralizing findings from a single model family.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how pretrained latent abilities influence Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) outcomes, even with low-quality or spurious reward signals. The study found that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in certain models, like Qwen2.5-Math, even when trained with random, incorrect, or format-only rewards. These spurious rewards achieved performance gains comparable to ground truth rewards for Qwen models. However, these gains did not generalize to other model families such as Llama3 or OLMo2, highlighting a strong model-dependency. A key factor identified is \"code reasoning\"—generating Python code for mathematical thinking—which is a latent ability present in Qwen models and is significantly amplified by RLVR, even with spurious rewards. This suggests RLVR primarily surfaces existing pretrained capabilities rather than teaching new ones, especially when the reward signal is weak. The research emphasizes the need for diverse model validation in RLVR studies and suggests that the effectiveness of spurious rewards is tied to the model's pretrained reasoning strategies.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve substantial performance gains in mathematical reasoning even with spurious reward signals (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format).\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, with Qwen2.5-Math models showing significant improvements while Llama3 and OLMo2 models do not.\n*   Pretrained latent abilities, specifically \"code reasoning\" (generating code for mathematical thought), play a crucial role, as RLVR amplifies this existing capability in Qwen models.\n*   The study suggests RLVR primarily elicits, rather than teaches, latent reasoning abilities, especially when reward signals are weak.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse model families due to observed differences in how pretrained abilities interact with RL training.",
