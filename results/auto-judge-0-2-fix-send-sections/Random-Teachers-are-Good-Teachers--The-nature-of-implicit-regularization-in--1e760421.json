SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the implicit regularization induced by teacher-student dynamics in self-distillation, specifically by using *randomly initialized teachers* instead of trained ones. The core finding is that even without \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or data augmentations, a student model can learn meaningful representations and even outperform its random teacher. This is attributed to the implicit regularization inherent in the gradient dynamics of the learning process. The study reveals that the student learns data-dependent and transferable features, identifying sparse subnetworks (lottery tickets) and settling near the boundary of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape. Interestingly, initializing the student closely to the teacher (low locality parameter α) amplifies this regularization effect, leading to better performance. These findings suggest that self-distillation and early-stage supervised training share common regularization mechanisms that can learn features independently of explicit labels or complex data augmentations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students trained with randomly initialized teachers learn data-dependent and transferable representations, outperforming their teachers.\n*   The learning process exhibits implicit regularization, enabling feature learning without relying on \"dark knowledge\" or data augmentations.\n*   Student checkpoints contain sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and are found at the border of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape.\n*   Initializing the student close to the teacher significantly amplifies the implicit regularization and improves learning outcomes.\n*   These label-independent dynamics mimic early-stage supervised learning, navigating the loss landscape without explicit supervision.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the implicit regularization induced by teacher-student dynamics in self-distillation, specifically by using random initializations for the teacher model. The key finding is that even without \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or data augmentations, the student model learns meaningful representations. This learning is data-dependent and transferable across tasks, as evidenced by improved linear probing accuracy over the teacher and raw inputs. A significant discovery is the \"locality phenomenon,\" where initializing the student closely to the teacher amplifies this implicit regularization, a behavior visualized through loss landscape analysis. The study reveals that these learning dynamics, particularly the emergence of sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and stability in the supervised loss landscape, mirror early stages of supervised training, suggesting label-independent optimization can explore the loss landscape effectively. The Adam optimizer was used for the teacher-student objective, and the observed stability in the student's learned parameters connects to SGD phenomena in valleys of the loss landscape.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students trained with random teachers demonstrate improved representation quality, indicating implicit regularization without relying on teacher's \"dark knowledge\" or data augmentations.\n*   A \"locality phenomenon\" is observed where closer initialization between student and teacher amplifies representation learning, visualized by a specific loss landscape structure featuring an asymmetric valley.\n*   The learned representations are data-dependent and transferable, and student checkpoints exhibit sparse subnetworks and stability in the supervised loss landscape, mirroring early supervised training dynamics.\n*   The Adam optimizer was used for the teacher-student objective, and the observed landscape properties are connected to SGD's behavior in loss valleys.\n*   The experimental setup isolates implicit regularization by using randomly initialized teachers and omitting data augmentations.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the implicit regularization induced by teacher-student dynamics in self-distillation, specifically by using randomly initialized teachers instead of trained ones. This setup isolates the effects of the learning dynamics from \"dark knowledge\" or data augmentations. The study reveals that even with random teachers, students exhibit significant improvements in probing accuracy, indicating meaningful feature learning. These learned representations are data-dependent and transferable, but degrade with random inputs. Crucially, the student checkpoints develop sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and reside near the boundaries of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape. A key finding is the \"locality phenomenon,\" where initializing the student close to the teacher (parameterized by α) amplifies implicit regularization, leading to better performance. This is explained through loss landscape visualizations showing asymmetric valleys near the teacher, a phenomenon also observed in supervised learning. The Adam optimizer is used for the teacher-student objective, and these dynamics are shown to mimic early stages of supervised training, including the development of lottery tickets and stability to batch orderings, without requiring label information.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students trained with random teachers outperform their teachers in representational quality, demonstrating implicit regularization without dark knowledge or data augmentation.\n*   The \"locality phenomenon\" shows that initializing the student close to the teacher (controlled by parameter α) amplifies learning, explained by asymmetric valleys in the loss landscape.\n*   Student checkpoints exhibit characteristics of \"lottery tickets\" (sparse subnetworks) and reside near linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, mimicking early supervised training dynamics.\n*   Adam optimizer is used for the teacher-student objective, and the learned features are shown to be data-dependent and transferable across tasks.",

The core of their experiment involves using a randomly initialized teacher instead of a trained one, thereby isolating the effects of implicit regularization from \"dark knowledge\" or data augmentation. Surprisingly, the student model, even when trained with a random teacher, exhibits significant improvements in representation quality, outperforming its teacher and even raw inputs on linear probing tasks. The study highlights a crucial \"locality phenomenon\" where initializing the student close to the teacher (controlled by parameter α) amplifies this implicit regularization, leading to better performance. This phenomenon is explained through loss landscape visualizations, revealing asymmetric valleys that the student exploits. Evidence for data-dependence is shown through increasing performance with dataset size and deterioration with random noise inputs. Furthermore, the student checkpoints exhibit characteristics of the \"lottery ticket hypothesis,\" containing sparse subnetworks and residing on the border of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, mirroring early stages of supervised training without explicit label information. The Adam optimizer is used for the teacher-student objective.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students trained with random teachers significantly outperform their teachers in representation quality, demonstrating implicit regularization without \"dark knowledge.\"\n*   A \"locality phenomenon\" is observed: initializing the student close to the teacher (controlled by parameter α) amplifies learning, explained by asymmetric valleys in the loss landscape.\n*   Learned representations are data-dependent, improving with data size and degrading with random inputs, while also showing transferability across tasks.\n*   Student checkpoints exhibit \"lottery ticket\" properties (sparse subnetworks) and reside near linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, mirroring early supervised training dynamics.\n*   The Adam optimizer is employed for minimizing the teacher-student objective, and the observed dynamics resemble early-phase supervised learning.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the implicit regularization induced by teacher-student dynamics in self-distillation, specifically by using random initializations for the teacher. The core finding is that even without a trained teacher or data augmentations, a student model can learn meaningful representations and outperform its random teacher. This phenomenon is attributed to the inherent regularization within the gradient dynamics. The research highlights a \"locality phenomenon,\" where initializing the student closely to the teacher amplifies this regularization, leading to better performance. Loss landscape visualizations reveal asymmetric valleys around the teacher, suggesting that this proximity allows the student to capitalize on flatter regions for better generalization. The study also provides evidence for data-dependence and transferability of these learned features, even when trained on random noise. Furthermore, the student checkpoints exhibit characteristics similar to \"lottery tickets\" found in supervised training, such as sparse subnetworks and stability to batch ordering, indicating that these dynamics can mimic early stages of supervised learning without explicit label information. The Adam optimizer was used for the teacher-student objective.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students distilling from random teachers significantly outperform their teachers in terms of representation quality, demonstrating implicit regularization without \"dark knowledge\" or data augmentation.\n*   A \"locality phenomenon\" is observed: initializing the student closer to the random teacher amplifies learning, a behavior explained by loss landscape visualizations showing asymmetric valleys that benefit generalization.\n*   Learned representations are data-dependent and transferable across tasks, even when the student is trained on random noise inputs, suggesting robust feature learning.\n*   Student checkpoints exhibit properties of \"lottery tickets\" (sparse subnetworks, stability to batch ordering), mirroring early phases of supervised training without labels.\n*   The Adam optimizer was employed for minimizing the teacher-student objective.",

By using a randomly initialized teacher instead of a trained one, the researchers isolate the inherent regularization effects of the learning process itself, independent of any \"dark knowledge\" from the teacher or data augmentations. They observe that students trained with random teachers significantly outperform their teachers in terms of representation quality, as measured by linear probing. This indicates that meaningful feature learning occurs solely due to the optimization dynamics. The study further highlights a \"locality phenomenon,\" where initializing the student close to the teacher amplifies this implicit regularization. Loss landscape visualizations reveal asymmetric valleys that may explain this locality effect. Importantly, the distilled student checkpoints exhibit characteristics similar to those found in the early stages of supervised training, such as containing sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and residing near the border of linear basins, all without direct label supervision. The Adam optimizer was used for the teacher-student objective.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the implicit regularization induced by teacher-student dynamics in self-distillation, specifically by using randomly initialized teachers instead of trained ones. This isolation of implicit regularization reveals surprising characteristics of the learning process. The student model, when trained to mimic a random teacher without any \"dark knowledge\" or data augmentation, significantly outperforms its teacher in terms of learned representations, as measured by linear probing. Evidence for data-dependence is shown through performance improvements with increasing dataset size and a drop when trained on random noise. Furthermore, the learned representations exhibit transferability to different tasks. A key finding is the \"locality phenomenon,\" where initializing the student close to the teacher amplifies this implicit regularization, explained through loss landscape visualizations showing asymmetric valleys. The student checkpoints also exhibit properties similar to \"lottery tickets\" found in early supervised training, suggesting that label-independent optimization dynamics can explore the supervised loss landscape. The Adam optimizer was used for the teacher-student objective.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students trained to mimic random teachers significantly outperform their teachers in representation quality, demonstrating implicit regularization without dark knowledge or data augmentation.\n*   Learned representations are data-dependent, improving with dataset size and showing transferability across tasks, even when the teacher is randomly initialized.\n*   Initializing the student closely to the teacher (locality phenomenon) amplifies implicit regularization, which is explained by the presence of asymmetric valleys in the loss landscape.\n*   Student checkpoints exhibit characteristics of \"lottery tickets\" and occupy regions near the border of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, suggesting label-independent optimization can mimic early supervised learning dynamics.\n*   The Adam optimizer was employed for the teacher-student objective in this study.",

Counter-intuitively, students trained with random teachers significantly outperform their teachers in terms of representation quality, as measured by linear probing accuracy. This improvement suggests that meaningful learning occurs even without \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or data augmentations. The study highlights a \"locality phenomenon,\" where initializing the student closer to the teacher amplifies this implicit regularization, a behavior explained through loss landscape visualizations that reveal asymmetric valleys. Furthermore, the learned representations are data-dependent, improving with dataset size and performing poorly on random noise, and are transferable across tasks. The student checkpoints also exhibit characteristics similar to \"lottery tickets,\" containing sparse subnetworks and residing near the border of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, suggesting that these label-independent dynamics mimic early-stage supervised training. The Adam optimizer is used for the teacher-student objective.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students trained with randomly initialized teachers significantly outperform their teachers, demonstrating implicit regularization without relying on \"dark knowledge\" or data augmentations.\n*   A \"locality phenomenon\" is observed, where initializing the student closer to the teacher amplifies representation learning, explained by asymmetric valleys in the loss landscape.\n*   Learned representations are data-dependent and transferable, improving with dataset size and generalizing to new tasks.\n*   Student checkpoints exhibit lottery ticket-like properties and align with early-stage supervised training dynamics, residing near linear basins in the loss landscape.\n*   The Adam optimizer is used for the teacher-student objective, and the findings challenge the sole reliance on dark knowledge for distillation success.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the implicit regularization induced by teacher-student dynamics in self-distillation, specifically by using randomly initialized teachers instead of trained ones. This setup isolates the regularization effect from \"dark knowledge\" and data augmentations. The study reveals that students can learn meaningful representations and even outperform their random teachers in terms of probing accuracy. This learning is data-dependent and transferable across tasks. Notably, the student checkpoints exhibit characteristics of sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and reside near the boundaries of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape. The research highlights a \"locality phenomenon\" where initializing the student close to the teacher amplifies this implicit regularization, potentially by capitalizing on asymmetric valleys in the loss landscape. The Adam optimizer is used for the teacher-student objective. These findings suggest that label-independent optimization dynamics can mimic early supervised training phases, exploring the loss landscape without explicit labels.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students trained with random teachers significantly outperform their teachers in probing accuracy, demonstrating implicit regularization without dark knowledge.\n*   Learned representations are data-dependent and transferable across tasks, with performance improving with dataset size and deteriorating with random inputs.\n*   Student checkpoints exhibit \"lottery ticket\" properties (sparse subnetworks) and reside at the edge of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, mirroring early supervised training dynamics.\n*   A \"locality phenomenon\" is observed: initializing the student close to the teacher amplifies learning, linked to asymmetric valleys in the loss landscape.\n*   The Adam optimizer is used for the teacher-student objective, and the findings suggest label-independent dynamics can navigate the supervised loss landscape.",
