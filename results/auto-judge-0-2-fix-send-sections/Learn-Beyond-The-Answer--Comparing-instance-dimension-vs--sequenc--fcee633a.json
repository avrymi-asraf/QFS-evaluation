      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces \"reflective augmentation\" (RefAug), a novel data augmentation technique for Large Language Models (LLMs) focused on enhancing mathematical reasoning. Unlike traditional instance-dimension augmentation (adding more problems), RefAug targets the sequence dimension by appending a \"reflective section\" to existing training instances. This section encourages the model to consider alternative approaches and follow-up extensions to a problem, fostering a deeper understanding beyond mere answer generation. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly improves performance in both standard single-round math QA tasks (outperforming direct fine-tuning by +7.2 accuracy) and more complex reflective reasoning scenarios (like error correction and follow-up questions), where other augmentation methods fall short. RefAug's benefits are also complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to further substantial gains when combined. The method is also shown to be effective for code generation tasks, indicating its broader applicability in improving LLM reasoning capabilities.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) enhances LLM mathematical reasoning by adding \"reflection\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) to training instances, focusing on the sequence dimension rather than just adding more data.\n*   RefAug improves performance on standard math reasoning tasks by +7.2 accuracy and significantly boosts capabilities in complex reflective reasoning scenarios where other methods falter.\n*   The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to synergistic performance gains when combined.\n*   RefAug is effective in enhancing LLM reasoning for code generation tasks as well, demonstrating its generalizability.\n*   The approach deepens the model's understanding of mathematical concepts and methodologies, primarily by reducing reasoning errors rather than calculation errors.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces \"reflective augmentation\" (RefAug) as a novel data augmentation technique for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, particularly in mathematical tasks. Unlike traditional instance-dimension augmentation that adds more training examples, RefAug operates on the sequence dimension by appending a \"reflective section\" to existing training instances. This section comprises \"alternative reasoning\" (presenting a different solution path) and \"follow-up reasoning\" (generalizing the problem through abstraction or analogy). Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance in standard single-round math QA tasks (+7.2 accuracy) and, crucially, excels in complex reflective reasoning scenarios (e.g., error correction, follow-up questions), where traditional methods falter. RefAug proves complementary to existing augmentation techniques, yielding further gains when combined. An ablation study confirms the value of both alternative and follow-up reasoning components. Error analysis indicates RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors rather than calculation errors, suggesting a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts. The method also shows promise in code generation tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) enhances LLM reasoning by adding \"reflection\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) to training data, operating on the sequence dimension.\n*   RefAug significantly improves performance on both standard math QA (+7.2 accuracy) and, notably, complex reflective reasoning tasks where other methods are less effective.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, with combinations leading to substantial synergistic gains.\n*   The technique primarily reduces reasoning errors, indicating it fosters a deeper understanding of mathematical principles rather than just improving calculation accuracy.\n*   RefAug demonstrates effectiveness in code generation tasks and is scalable, with performance increasing as more data is augmented.",
