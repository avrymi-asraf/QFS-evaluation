SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces a \"causal inner product\" that bridges the gap between the input (embedding) and output (unembedding) representation spaces in large language models. The researchers formalize the concept of linear representation in both spaces using counterfactual pairs of words. They demonstrate that the unembedding representation is linked to \"measurement\" (predicting concepts) and the embedding representation to \"intervention\" (steering concepts). The core contribution is the causal inner product, defined by the property that causally separable concepts are orthogonal. This specific inner product acts as a Riesz isomorphism, effectively unifying the embedding and unembedding representations into a single conceptual space. In this unified space, geometric notions like similarity and projection become semantically meaningful. Experiments with LLaMA-2 confirm the existence of these linear representations and show that the causal inner product respects semantic structure and enables both interpretation and control by connecting these distinct representation spaces.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The \"causal inner product\" is proposed to unify the conceptually separate input (embedding) and output (unembedding) representation spaces by enforcing orthogonality between causally separable concepts.\n*   Linear representations are formalized using counterfactual pairs, linking unembedding representations to measurement (probing) and embedding representations to intervention (steering).\n*   The causal inner product, when applied, transforms these spaces such that the embedding and unembedding representations of a concept coincide, creating a unified representation space.\n*   This unification allows geometric operations (like similarity and projection) to be semantically meaningful within the language model's representation space.\n*   Empirical results with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear representations and demonstrate that the causal inner product effectively bridges the embedding and unembedding spaces for interpretation and control.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces a \"causal inner product\" that acts as a bridge to unify the conceptually distinct input (embedding) and output (unembedding) representation spaces in large language models. The researchers formalize the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" suggesting concepts are represented linearly as directions. They define unembedding representations based on counterfactual word pairs (e.g., \"king\" vs. \"queen\") in the output space, linking them to measurement. Embedding representations are defined in the input context space, tied to intervention. The core contribution is Theorem 3.2, which demonstrates that a causal inner product, defined by the orthogonality of causally separable concepts (e.g., gender and language), unifies these spaces. This is achieved through a Riesz isomorphism, transforming unembedding representations into embedding representations. Theorem 3.4 provides a closed-form for this causal inner product, using covariance of unembedding vectors. This approach overcomes the limitations of the Euclidean inner product, which fails to capture semantic structure consistently, by ensuring causally separable concepts are orthogonal. This unification is crucial for constructing intervention representations from unembedding vectors, enabling controlled manipulation of model behavior.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The \"causal inner product\" unifies input (embedding) and output (unembedding) representation spaces by enforcing orthogonality between representations of causally separable concepts.\n*   Theorem 3.2 establishes a Riesz isomorphism where the causal inner product maps unembedding representations to their corresponding embedding representations, bridging the two spaces.\n*   Theorem 3.4 provides a closed-form for the causal inner product, enabling its estimation and demonstrating that it overcomes the limitations of the Euclidean inner product, which does not inherently respect semantic separability.\n*   This framework allows for the construction of intervention representations by transforming unembedding vectors into embedding representations, facilitating targeted control of model outputs.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"Linear Representation Hypothesis,\" proposing that high-level concepts in language models are represented as linear directions. It introduces a \"causal inner product\" as a crucial tool to bridge the gap between distinct input (embedding) and output (unembedding) representation spaces. The core idea is that causally separable concepts (those that can vary independently) should be represented as orthogonal vectors in this new geometric framework. Theorem 3.2 demonstrates that this causal inner product, via a Riesz isomorphism, unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, effectively making them equivalent. This unification is achieved by transforming the representation spaces such that the Euclidean inner product in the transformed space corresponds to the causal inner product. Theorem 3.4 provides an explicit closed-form for this causal inner product, derived from the covariance of unembedding vectors and the structure of concept representations. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate that this causal inner product indeed respects semantic structure and allows for the construction of intervention representations by mapping from unembedding to embedding vectors, overcoming the limitations of the standard Euclidean inner product.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The \"causal inner product\" is defined to enforce orthogonality between representations of causally separable concepts, unifying embedding and unembedding spaces through a Riesz isomorphism (Theorem 3.2).\n*   An explicit closed-form for the causal inner product is derived, relying on the covariance of unembedding vectors and the structure of concept representations (Theorem 3.4).\n*   The causal inner product overcomes limitations of the Euclidean inner product, which does not inherently respect the semantic separability of concepts.\n*   The causal inner product enables the construction of intervention representations by mapping from the unembedding space to the embedding space, facilitating model control.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the concept of a \"causal inner product\" to bridge the gap between the input (embedding) and output (unembedding) representation spaces in large language models. The authors formalize the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" proposing that high-level concepts are represented linearly as directions in these spaces. They demonstrate that the unembedding space relates to \"measurement\" (e.g., predicting word probabilities) and the embedding space relates to \"intervention\" (e.g., steering model behavior). The core contribution is the causal inner product, defined by the orthogonality of causally separable concepts. This specific inner product enables a Riesz isomorphism that unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, effectively making them equivalent in a transformed space. This unification allows for the construction of intervention representations from unembedding representations and provides a geometric framework for understanding and manipulating linguistic concepts within LLMs. Empirical results with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and the properties of the causal inner product.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The \"causal inner product\" is defined as an inner product where causally separable concepts are represented by orthogonal vectors.\n*   This causal inner product facilitates a Riesz isomorphism that unifies the distinct input (embedding) and output (unembedding) representation spaces.\n*   The unified space allows for the construction of intervention (steering) representations by transforming unembedding representations.\n*   Empirical validation on LLaMA-2 confirms the existence of linear representations and the semantic properties of the causal inner product, showing it better captures language structure than the Euclidean inner product.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the concept of a \"causal inner product\" to bridge the gap between distinct input (embedding) and output (unembedding) representation spaces in language models. The authors formalize the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" suggesting concepts are linear directions within these spaces. They define unembedding representations via counterfactual word pairs and show their connection to \"measurement.\" Similarly, embedding representations are defined and linked to \"intervention.\" The core contribution is the causal inner product, which mandates that causally separable concepts (those that can vary independently) are represented orthogonally. This specific inner product has a crucial property: it unifies the embedding and unembedding representations through a Riesz isomorphism. By transforming the spaces using this inner product, the previously separate representations become equivalent. The paper derives an explicit closed-form for this causal inner product, relying on statistical properties of word embeddings. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate that this causal inner product captures semantic structure and enables unified interpretation and control, outperforming the standard Euclidean inner product.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The \"causal inner product\" is defined as an inner product that makes causally separable concepts orthogonal, thereby unifying distinct embedding (input) and unembedding (output) representation spaces.\n*   This unification is achieved via a Riesz isomorphism, where the causal inner product transforms unembedding representations into their corresponding embedding representations.\n*   An explicit closed-form for the causal inner product is derived using statistical properties of word embeddings, specifically relating it to the inverse covariance of word representations.\n*   Empirical results demonstrate that the causal inner product effectively captures semantic relationships and is essential for bridging the gap between measurement (unembedding) and intervention (embedding) concepts, outperforming the Euclidean inner product.",

The core idea is that causally separable concepts (like language and gender) should be represented by orthogonal vectors in a unified space. The authors formalize linear representations in both embedding and unembedding spaces using counterfactual pairs. They demonstrate that the unembedding representation links to \"measurement\" (predicting concepts from representations) and the embedding representation links to \"intervention\" (manipulating concepts via representations). Crucially, Theorem 3.2 shows that a causal inner product, via a Riesz isomorphism, transforms unembedding representations into their corresponding embedding representations, effectively unifying them. Theorem 3.4 provides an explicit form for this causal inner product, derived from the covariance of unembedding vectors. This approach allows for the construction of intervention representations from unembedding vectors, offering a way to control model behavior by manipulating these unified representations, as validated by experiments on LLaMA-2.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is defined as one that makes causally separable concepts orthogonal, unifying embedding and unembedding representations through a Riesz isomorphism (Theorem 3.2).\n*   An explicit closed-form for the causal inner product is derived using the inverse covariance of unembedding vectors and the concept representations (Theorem 3.4).\n*   This framework allows for the construction of intervention representations from unembedding vectors, facilitating model control by manipulating these unified representations.\n*   Experiments on LLaMA-2 empirically validate that the causal inner product respects semantic structure and enables effective measurement and intervention.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces a \"causal inner product\" as a bridge to unify the conceptually distinct input (embedding) and output (unembedding) representation spaces in large language models. The authors formalize linear representations in both spaces, linking unembedding representations to measurement and embedding representations to intervention. They propose that causally separable concepts should be represented by orthogonal vectors, defining the causal inner product based on this principle. Theorem 3.2 demonstrates that this causal inner product, via a Riesz isomorphism, maps unembedding representations to their corresponding embedding representations, effectively unifying them. The paper derives a closed-form for this inner product (Theorem 3.4) using statistical properties of word embeddings, showing it relates to the inverse covariance matrix of word embeddings. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate that this causal inner product respects semantic structure and that interventions can be constructed by transforming unembedding representations to embedding representations. The study highlights the limitations of the Euclidean inner product and demonstrates how the causal inner product overcomes these by respecting language structure, enabling a coherent geometric understanding of LLM representations.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the concept of a \"causal inner product\" to bridge the gap between the input (embedding) and output (unembedding) representation spaces in large language models. The authors formalize the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" suggesting concepts are linear directions. They define unembedding representations using counterfactual word pairs, linking them to measurement, and embedding representations, linking them to intervention. A key contribution is the causal inner product, defined by making causally separable concepts orthogonal. Theorem 3.2 demonstrates that this causal inner product, through a Riesz isomorphism, unifies embedding and unembedding representations, showing they become equivalent in a transformed space. Theorem 3.4 provides a closed-form for this inner product using the inverse of the covariance matrix of unembedding vectors. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate that this causal inner product respects semantic structure, unlike the Euclidean inner product, enabling the construction of intervention representations from unembedding vectors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is defined by making causally separable concepts represented by orthogonal vectors, unifying embedding and unembedding spaces via a Riesz isomorphism (Theorem 3.2).\n*   The causal inner product can be explicitly derived using the inverse of the covariance matrix of unembedding vectors sampled from the vocabulary (Theorem 3.4).\n*   The causal inner product is crucial for geometric interpretations like similarity and projection, overcoming the limitations of the Euclidean inner product which does not inherently capture semantic structure.\n*   Unembedding representations can be transformed into embedding (intervention) representations using the causal inner product, facilitating model control.",
