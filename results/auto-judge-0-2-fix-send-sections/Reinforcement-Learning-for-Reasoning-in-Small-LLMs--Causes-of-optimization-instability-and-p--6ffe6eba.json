SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of small language models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints. Using a 1.5-billion-parameter model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) and the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, the research demonstrates significant reasoning gains on mathematical benchmarks with minimal data and computational cost. However, prolonged training revealed optimization instability and performance degradation. Key issues observed include accuracy decline after initial improvements, unstable KL divergence, and increased completion lengths leading to unreadable or mixed-language outputs. These problems were partially mitigated by mixing easier and harder problems and using cosine rewards to control output length, though extended length limits were still found necessary for complex tasks. The study highlights that while RL is effective for small LLMs, challenges related to optimization stability and length constraints emerge with extended training, suggesting a need for careful hyperparameter tuning and potentially multi-stage training strategies.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements within the first 50-100 training steps using RL with high-quality data, but performance degrades with prolonged training, especially under strict length constraints.\n*   Optimization instability, evidenced by unstable KL divergence and fluctuating accuracy, can occur with extended RL fine-tuning of small LLMs.\n*   Length constraints are a significant challenge, leading to truncated reasoning and performance degradation. Using cosine rewards helps control length, but longer limits may be needed for complex problems.\n*   Multilingual base models can exhibit language drift during extended RL fine-tuning, producing non-English or mixed-language outputs.\n*   Mixing easier and harder problems in the training data can help stabilize reasoning behavior and improve early performance.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the efficacy of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small LLMs (1.5B parameters) under strict resource constraints. The research found that while RL can lead to rapid reasoning improvements within the first 50-100 training steps, prolonged training results in performance degradation and optimization instability. Specifically, Experiment 1 showed accuracy decline after 200 steps, attributed to issues with length constraints and reward misalignment, leading to increased completion lengths and unreadable content. Experiment 2, by mixing easier and harder problems with reduced length constraints, improved initial performance and stabilized behavior, but still exhibited late-stage instability and KL divergence issues. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to better control output length, stabilizing it significantly, but noted that extended length limits are still necessary for complex tasks, especially with multilingual base models. The base model's multilingual nature also contributed to language drift. These findings highlight that while RL is a cost-effective method for small LLMs, challenges with optimization stability, length constraints, and multilingualism need careful consideration for sustained performance gains.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 from 63% to 80%) within 50-100 RL fine-tuning steps, but prolonged training leads to performance degradation.\n*   Optimization instability and performance degradation are linked to strict length constraints and reward misalignment, causing increased token generation and content drift.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems can initially stabilize training, but long-term stability remains a challenge.\n*   Cosine rewards help control output length, improving training consistency, but do not fully resolve issues with extremely hard tasks or multilingual base models.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model contributes to language drift during extended training, requiring explicit control mechanisms.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the fine-tuning of small language models (LLMs) for reasoning under strict resource constraints, using a 1.5B parameter model and the GRPO algorithm. Experiment 1 showed that while small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 70%) within the first 50-100 steps, prolonged training led to performance degradation. This was attributed to optimization instability, with accuracy dropping significantly and completion lengths fluctuating erratically, suggesting issues with reward misalignment and exceeding length constraints (4096 tokens). Experiment 2, by mixing easier and harder problems and reducing length constraints (3584 tokens), improved initial performance (AMC23 to 80%) and stabilized behavior for longer, but still exhibited late-stage instability and KL divergence issues. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to control output length, achieving better length stability (1000-3500 tokens) but slightly lower peak performance and persistent multilingual output drift, indicating the need for explicit language controls or longer contexts for complex tasks. The base model's multilingual nature was a key factor in performance degradation and language drift.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Prolonged RL fine-tuning of small LLMs under strict length constraints (e.g., 4096 tokens) leads to optimization instability and performance degradation, characterized by accuracy drops and erratic output lengths.\n*   Mixing easier and harder problems can initially stabilize reasoning and improve performance, but long-term stability remains a challenge.\n*   Cosine rewards help stabilize completion lengths, improving training consistency, but may not fully address performance on extremely hard tasks or mitigate multilingual output drift without additional measures.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model is a significant factor contributing to language drift and performance inconsistencies during extended fine-tuning.\n*   Effective dataset curation and carefully designed reward functions (accuracy, cosine, format) are crucial for balancing performance gains with resource limitations in small LLMs.",

The research highlights that while RL can lead to rapid reasoning gains in small LLMs, optimization instability and performance degradation become significant issues with prolonged training. Experiment 1 demonstrated that after initial improvements, accuracy dropped due to prolonged training and strict length constraints, leading to reward misalignment and increased completion lengths. Experiment 2 suggested that mixing easier problems with harder ones could stabilize training and reduce completion lengths, but long-term instability persisted. Experiment 3 showed that cosine rewards effectively stabilized completion lengths, improving training consistency, but did not fully resolve issues related to the multilingual nature of the base model and the need for extended length limits on complex tasks. Key limitations include insufficient length constraints and the multilingual nature of the base model, which contributed to language drift and truncation of reasoning processes. The findings suggest a trade-off between efficiency and reasoning depth, with curriculum-like strategies and more robust length control being crucial for sustained performance.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n* Prolonged RL fine-tuning of small LLMs can lead to optimization instability and performance degradation, particularly when strict length constraints are imposed.\n* Experiment 1 showed that initial rapid reasoning gains were followed by accuracy drops due to reward misalignment and increasing completion lengths beyond the model's capacity.\n* Experiment 2 indicated that mixing easy and hard problems could improve initial stability, but long-term instability and multilingual tendencies remained challenges.\n* Experiment 3 demonstrated that cosine rewards effectively stabilized output lengths, improving training consistency, but the multilingual nature of the base model and the need for longer completion limits persisted.\n* Key limitations identified were insufficient length constraints and the multilingual nature of the base model, which impacted output consistency and reasoning depth.",

The key challenges identified during fine-tuning were optimization instability and performance degradation, particularly in prolonged training. Experiment 1 showed that while small LLMs achieve rapid reasoning gains within 50-100 steps, prolonged training leads to accuracy degradation and unstable output lengths, often exceeding token limits. Experiment 2, which mixed easy and hard problems, improved initial performance and stabilized behavior but still exhibited instability and multilingual tendencies after ~150-200 steps, indicated by unstable KL divergence. Experiment 3, using a cosine reward to control length, stabilized output lengths but did not fully resolve multilingual issues, suggesting a need for longer completion lengths for complex tasks and explicit language control. The base model's multilingual nature was a persistent factor contributing to language drift. Ultimately, the research highlights a trade-off between efficiency and reasoning depth, with small LLMs achieving competitive performance at a fraction of the cost but facing inherent limitations in long-term stability and handling complex reasoning chains within strict constraints.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Prolonged RL fine-tuning of small LLMs can lead to optimization instability and performance degradation, evidenced by accuracy drops and unstable KL divergence after initial gains.\n*   Strict token length constraints are a significant factor in performance degradation, forcing premature truncation of reasoning processes and leading to unstable output lengths.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base small LLM contributes to language drift and complicates monolingual optimization, even with explicit instructions.\n*   While cosine rewards help stabilize output lengths, they may not fully resolve issues with complex reasoning tasks or multilingual tendencies, necessitating careful reward design and potentially longer context windows.\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements with minimal data and cost, but face challenges in long-term stability and generalization to extremely complex tasks under resource limitations.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the effectiveness and challenges of using reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of small language models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints. The research focuses on a 1.5B parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, trained on a limited dataset and hardware within a 24-hour timeframe. The findings indicate that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) within the initial 50-100 training steps using high-quality data. However, prolonged training leads to optimization instability and performance degradation, particularly due to strict length constraints (maximum completion length) and the multilingual nature of the base model, causing language drift and truncated reasoning. Experiment 2 showed that mixing easy and hard problems helped stabilize early performance but did not resolve long-term issues. Experiment 3 demonstrated that cosine rewards effectively control output length but don't fully address language drift. The study concludes that while RL is a cost-effective method for boosting small LLM reasoning, challenges related to optimization stability, length constraints, and multilingualism need to be addressed for sustained performance.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning gains rapidly (50-100 steps) with RL fine-tuning on high-quality data, but prolonged training causes performance degradation.\n*   Optimization instability and performance decay in small LLMs during RL fine-tuning are linked to strict length constraints and the multilingual nature of the base model, leading to language drift and truncated reasoning.\n*   A mix of easy and hard problems can improve early performance and stabilize reasoning, while cosine rewards help control output length, but neither fully resolves long-term stability or multilingual issues.\n*   RL-based fine-tuning offers a highly cost-effective and data-efficient approach for enhancing small LLM reasoning compared to larger models or extensive datasets.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of small language models (LLMs), specifically a 1.5B parameter model, under strict resource constraints. The research identified several causes of optimization instability and performance degradation during RL fine-tuning. Experiment 1 showed that while small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains within 50-100 steps, prolonged training, especially under strict length constraints (e.g., 4096 tokens), leads to significant accuracy degradation, unstable rewards, and unintended output characteristics like mixed-language content and increased completion lengths. Experiment 2, which incorporated a mix of easy and hard problems with a reduced length constraint (3584 tokens), improved initial performance and stabilized behavior but still exhibited late-stage instability, evidenced by fluctuating KL divergence. Experiment 3, using a cosine reward to control length, stabilized output lengths more effectively but did not fully resolve multilingual tendencies. The limitations highlight that strict length constraints can truncate reasoning, and the multilingual nature of the base model contributes to language drift. These findings suggest a trade-off between efficiency and reasoning depth, where early gains are achievable but long-term stability and handling of complex tasks require careful management of length constraints and potential language issues.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Prolonged RL fine-tuning of small LLMs under strict length constraints (e.g., 4096 tokens) leads to performance degradation, unstable rewards, and unintended outputs like mixed-language content.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems can improve initial reasoning and stabilize early training, but late-stage instability, indicated by fluctuating KL divergence, persists.\n*   Cosine rewards effectively stabilize output lengths, improving training consistency, but may not fully resolve issues with complex tasks or multilingual base models.\n*   Strict maximum completion lengths can prematurely truncate reasoning processes, limiting the model's ability to handle extremely difficult problems.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, contributes to language drift and complicates monolingual optimization efforts.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of small language models (LLMs), specifically a 1.5B parameter model, under strict resource constraints. The research identified several causes of optimization instability and performance degradation during RL fine-tuning. Experiment 1 showed that while small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains within 50-100 steps, prolonged training, especially under strict length constraints (e.g., 4096 tokens), leads to significant accuracy degradation, unstable rewards, and unintended output characteristics like mixed-language content and increased completion lengths. Experiment 2, which incorporated a mix of easy and hard problems with a reduced length constraint (3584 tokens), improved initial performance and stabilized behavior but still exhibited late-stage instability, evidenced by fluctuating KL divergence. Experiment 3, using a cosine reward to control length, stabilized output lengths more effectively but did not fully resolve multilingual tendencies. The limitations highlight that strict length constraints can truncate reasoning, and the multilingual nature of the base model contributes to language drift. These findings suggest a trade-off between efficiency and reasoning depth, where early gains are achievable but long-term stability and handling of complex tasks require careful management of length constraints and potential language issues.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Prolonged RL fine-tuning of small LLMs under strict length constraints (e.g., 4096 tokens) leads to performance degradation, unstable rewards, and unintended outputs like mixed-language content.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems can improve initial reasoning and stabilize early training, but late-stage instability, indicated by fluctuating KL divergence, persists.\n*   Cosine rewards effectively stabilize output lengths, improving training consistency, but may not fully resolve issues with complex tasks or multilingual base models.\n*   Strict maximum completion lengths can prematurely truncate reasoning processes, limiting the model's ability to handle extremely difficult problems.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, contributes to language drift and complicates monolingual optimization efforts.",
