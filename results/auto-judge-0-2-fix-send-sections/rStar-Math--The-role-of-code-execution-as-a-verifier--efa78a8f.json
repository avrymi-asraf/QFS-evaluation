SUMMARY:\nThe paper introduces rStar-Math, a novel approach that empowers small language models (SLMs) to achieve state-of-the-art math reasoning capabilities, rivaling even larger models like OpenAI's o1. A core innovation is the use of code execution as a verifier for synthetic reasoning data. rStar-Math employs a \"code-augmented Chain-of-Thought\" (CoT) data synthesis method, where generated reasoning steps are paired with Python code. Only steps whose corresponding code executes successfully are retained, effectively verifying the correctness of intermediate reasoning. This code execution mechanism is integrated within Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts, allowing for the generation of step-by-step verified reasoning trajectories. These verified trajectories are then used to train both a policy SLM and a process preference model (PPM). The PPM, in turn, guides the MCTS process, ensuring that the generated data is of high quality and progressively improves the reasoning abilities of the SLMs through a self-evolutionary process. This method significantly mitigates errors in intermediate steps, a common issue in LLM-generated math reasoning.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   **Code Execution for Verification:** rStar-Math utilizes Python code execution to verify the correctness of each generated reasoning step, filtering out erroneous intermediate steps.\n*   **Verified Trajectories:** This code-augmented approach generates \"step-by-step verified reasoning trajectories,\" ensuring higher data quality for training.\n*   **MCTS Integration:** Code execution is integrated into Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts, enabling the generation of reliable, verified data.\n*   **Mitigation of Hallucinations:** By verifying steps with code, the method effectively addresses the issue of LLMs hallucinating incorrect intermediate steps that might still lead to a correct final answer by chance.",
