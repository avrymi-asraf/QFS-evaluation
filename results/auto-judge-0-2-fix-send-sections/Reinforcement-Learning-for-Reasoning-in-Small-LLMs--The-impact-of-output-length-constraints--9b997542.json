SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the impact of output length constraints on training small LLMs (1.5 billion parameters) for complex reasoning tasks using reinforcement learning (RL). The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset, training within strict resource limits (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24 hours). Results show rapid reasoning improvements, with AMC23 accuracy increasing from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7% with minimal data ($42 cost). However, prolonged training under length constraints led to optimization instability and performance degradation. Specifically, experiments highlighted that while short training bursts (50-100 steps) yield significant gains, longer training results in issues like truncated reasoning and multilingual output drift. The cosine reward helped stabilize output lengths, but longer lengths were still needed for harder problems. The findings underscore the efficacy of RL for small LLMs but also reveal critical challenges with length management and optimization stability in resource-constrained environments.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Training small LLMs (1.5B parameters) with RL can achieve significant reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) under strict resource constraints and low cost ($42).\n*   Prolonged training beyond 50-100 steps under output length constraints leads to optimization instability and performance degradation in small LLMs.\n*   Length constraints can cause premature truncation of reasoning processes for complex problems, limiting the model's full potential.\n*   The cosine reward function helps stabilize output lengths, but additional measures may be needed for extremely complex tasks or to mitigate multilingual drift.\n*   Despite challenges, RL-based fine-tuning offers a cost-effective and data-efficient alternative for enhancing reasoning in small LLMs compared to larger models and extensive datasets.",

The researchers fine-tuned a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, under strict resource constraints (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24 hours). They found that while small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains with limited, high-quality data and efficient RL methods like GRPO, prolonged training can lead to performance degradation and instability. Specifically, output length constraints were identified as a significant challenge, causing premature truncation of reasoning processes and influencing model behavior. Experiment 1 showed degradation after 200 steps, likely due to exceeding length limits. Experiment 2 demonstrated that mixing easier problems with harder ones improved initial performance and stabilized behavior under reduced length constraints, though long-term stability remained an issue. Experiment 3 highlighted that cosine rewards effectively controlled output length, improving consistency but requiring longer completion limits for very difficult tasks. Overall, the approach achieved competitive reasoning performance with significantly lower costs and data requirements than larger models, though multilingual drift and length limitations present ongoing challenges. Future work could involve extending training duration, improving language control, and broadening domain generalization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n* Output length constraints are a significant challenge for small LLMs undergoing RL for reasoning, leading to performance degradation and instability with prolonged training.\n* Mixing easier and harder problems can improve initial reasoning performance and stabilize training for small LLMs under reduced length constraints.\n* Cosine rewards effectively stabilize output lengths in small LLMs, but longer completion limits are needed for highly complex reasoning tasks.\n* Small LLMs can achieve competitive reasoning performance with minimal data and cost using RL, offering a resource-efficient alternative to larger models, despite limitations like multilingual drift.\n* Future directions include extending training duration and implementing better language control mechanisms to overcome current limitations.",

The researchers adapted the GRPO algorithm and curated a high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset, achieving significant performance gains on benchmarks like AMC23 (63% to 80%) and AIME24 (reaching 46.7%) with minimal resources ($42 cost, 7,000 samples). However, prolonged training under strict length constraints (3584-4096 tokens) led to performance degradation and optimization instability, particularly after 200 steps. Experiment 2 showed that mixing easy and hard problems improved initial performance and stabilized behavior, but long-term stability remained an issue. Experiment 3 demonstrated that a cosine reward effectively controlled output length, enhancing consistency but slightly sacrificing peak performance. Limitations include insufficient length for extremely hard problems and multilingual drift from the base model. Future work suggests extending training, improving language control, and exploring broader domain generalization to address these challenges.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n* Training small LLMs with RL can achieve rapid reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 from 63% to 80%) within 50-100 steps, but prolonged training under strict length constraints (3584-4096 tokens) leads to performance degradation after ~200 steps.\n* Mixing easy and hard problems in the training data (Experiment 2) improved initial reasoning and stabilized behavior, although long-term stability remained a challenge.\n* A cosine reward function (Experiment 3) effectively stabilized output lengths, improving training consistency, but extending length limits is crucial for extremely complex tasks, especially with multilingual base models.\n* The proposed RL approach achieves competitive reasoning performance with significantly lower data usage and cost ($42) compared to larger models and other small LLMs ($1088-$3629).\n* Key limitations include the inability of the fixed output length to accommodate very complex reasoning chains and multilingual drift from the base model, necessitating future research into extended training, better language control, and domain generalization.",

The findings reveal that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains with limited data and cost, with one variant (Open-RS3) achieving 46.7% on AIME24, surpassing o1-preview. However, prolonged training under strict length constraints leads to performance degradation and optimization instability. Experiment 1 showed initial gains followed by degradation after 200 steps due to exceeding length limits. Experiment 2, using mixed difficulty data, improved early performance and stability but still suffered from late-stage issues. Experiment 3, employing a cosine reward, effectively stabilized output lengths but slightly reduced peak performance, highlighting the trade-off between length control and accuracy. The study concludes that while RL is a cost-effective approach for small LLMs, challenges like length constraints and multilingual drift necessitate further research, including extending training durations and improving language control mechanisms.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements with RL, demonstrating impressive performance on benchmarks like AIME24 with minimal data and cost ($42).\n*   Prolonged training under strict output length constraints leads to performance degradation and optimization instability in small LLMs.\n*   Mixing easier problems with harder ones can improve initial reasoning and stabilize behavior, but long-term stability remains a challenge.\n*   Cosine rewards effectively stabilize output lengths, offering better training consistency, but may sacrifice peak performance on very complex tasks.\n*   Limitations include the inability of current length constraints to handle extremely hard problems and multilingual drift from the base model, suggesting future work on longer training and better language control.",

The research adapted the GRPO algorithm and curated a high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset for a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, under strict resource limitations (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24 hours). Experiments revealed that while small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) with limited data and cost ($42), prolonged training under strict length constraints leads to performance degradation and instability. Mixing easier problems with harder ones improved initial performance and stabilized behavior, but long-term stability remained a challenge. Using a cosine reward helped control output length, but extending length limits was necessary for extremely hard tasks, especially with multilingual base models. The findings highlight the efficacy of RL for small LLMs but also underscore the critical role of output length constraints and the need for careful data curation and reward design to prevent optimization instability and unintended behaviors like multilingual drift.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   **Length Constraints and Degradation:** Strict output length constraints significantly impact small LLMs trained for reasoning, leading to performance degradation and instability after initial gains.\n*   **Mixed Data Benefits:** Incorporating a mix of easy and hard problems can improve initial reasoning performance and stabilize training behavior under length constraints.\n*   **Cosine Reward for Length Control:** Cosine rewards effectively stabilize output lengths, improving training consistency, but may sacrifice peak accuracy on complex tasks.\n*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** The RL-based approach for small LLMs offers substantial reasoning improvements at a fraction of the cost and data compared to larger models.\n*   **Multilingual Drift:** The multilingual nature of base models can lead to unintended language drift, complicating monolingual optimization efforts under length constraints.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the impact of output length constraints on the stability and efficacy of training small LLMs for complex reasoning tasks using reinforcement learning (RL). The researchers fine-tuned a 1.5-billion-parameter model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) under strict computational constraints. They found that while RL can lead to rapid reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%), prolonged training under strict length limits (4096 tokens) causes performance degradation, unstable rewards, and undesirable output characteristics like non-English content. Experiment 2 showed that mixing easy and hard problems initially stabilized behavior and improved performance, but long-term stability remained a challenge. Experiment 3 demonstrated that cosine rewards effectively controlled output length, leading to more consistent training, but at the cost of slightly lower peak performance and failing to fully resolve multilingual drift. Despite these challenges, the Open-RS variants achieved competitive reasoning scores comparable to larger models, at a significantly lower cost ($42 vs. thousands) and with much less data (7,000 samples vs. tens of thousands). The limitations highlight the need for longer training, better length control, and language management for complex reasoning tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Strict output length constraints (e.g., 4096 tokens) can lead to performance degradation and instability in small LLMs during prolonged RL training for complex reasoning.\n*   Mixing easier problems with challenging ones can initially stabilize training and improve performance in small LLMs, but long-term stability remains an issue.\n*   Cosine rewards effectively control output length, improving training consistency, but may slightly reduce peak performance and do not fully resolve issues like multilingual drift in base models.\n*   RL fine-tuning enables small LLMs to achieve competitive reasoning performance with significantly less data and cost compared to larger models, making advanced reasoning more accessible.\n*   Future work should focus on extending training duration, improving language control, and adapting length management strategies to better handle complex reasoning tasks.",

The research found that while RL can rapidly improve reasoning capabilities in small LLMs (e.g., 1.5B parameters) with limited data and computational resources, prolonged training under strict length constraints leads to performance degradation and instability. Specifically, models showed initial gains but later exhibited accuracy drops, increased completion lengths, and even language drift. Experiment 1 demonstrated performance degradation after 200 steps due to strict length limits. Experiment 2 showed that mixing easy and hard problems improved initial performance and stabilized behavior but did not fully resolve long-term issues. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to control output length, leading to more stable training but sacrificing peak performance, and highlighted the need for extended length limits for harder tasks, especially with multilingual base models. The study successfully demonstrated that RL-based fine-tuning can be a cost-effective alternative to large-scale approaches, achieving competitive results with significantly less data and cost, though length constraints and multilingual drift remain key challenges for future research.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Strict output length constraints can lead to performance degradation and instability in small LLMs trained with RL for complex reasoning tasks, with degradation observed after approximately 200 training steps.\n*   Mixing easier problems with harder ones can improve initial reasoning performance and stabilize training for small LLMs, but does not fully resolve long-term stability issues under length constraints.\n*   Cosine rewards effectively stabilize completion lengths and improve training consistency for small LLMs, but may sacrifice peak accuracy, and extended length limits are necessary for extremely complex tasks, especially with multilingual base models.\n*   RL-based fine-tuning offers a highly cost-effective and data-efficient method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small LLMs, achieving competitive performance with significantly fewer resources than larger models.\n*   Multilingual drift in the base model and insufficient maximum completion lengths are identified as significant limitations that require further investigation and potential solutions like longer training or explicit language controls.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the impact of output length constraints on the stability and efficacy of training small LLMs for complex reasoning tasks using reinforcement learning (RL). The research applied the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and a curated mathematical reasoning dataset to a 1.5-billion-parameter model under strict computational constraints (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24 hours). Experiments revealed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) within initial training phases (50-100 steps) using high-quality data. However, prolonged training under strict length constraints (4096 tokens) led to performance degradation, optimization instability, and multilingual drift. Incorporating easier problems and using cosine rewards helped stabilize training and control output length, though extended lengths were still needed for very hard tasks. The study demonstrated significant cost and data efficiency compared to larger models, achieving competitive performance with minimal resources. Key limitations included insufficient length for complex reasoning chains and the base model's multilingual nature. Future work suggests extending training, improving language control, and domain generalization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Prolonged training of small LLMs for reasoning under strict output length constraints (e.g., 4096 tokens) leads to performance degradation and optimization instability.\n*   A mix of easy and hard problems, along with cosine rewards, can improve early reasoning performance and stabilize output lengths, but limitations persist for very complex tasks.\n*   The research highlights the efficacy of RL for small LLMs, achieving competitive reasoning with significantly lower costs and data requirements compared to larger models.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the impact of output length constraints on the stability and efficacy of training small LLMs for complex reasoning tasks using reinforcement learning (RL). The research found that while RL can lead to rapid reasoning improvements in small LLMs (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80% within 50-100 steps), prolonged training under strict length constraints (4096 tokens) leads to performance degradation and instability. Experiment 1 showed accuracy dropping significantly after 200 steps, with increased completion lengths and non-English outputs. Experiment 2, using a mix of easy and hard problems with a reduced length constraint (3584 tokens), improved initial performance but still suffered from late-stage instability. Experiment 3, employing a cosine reward to control length, stabilized output lengths but showed a trade-off with peak performance and persistent multilingual drift. The study demonstrates that small LLMs can achieve competitive reasoning with minimal resources ($42 cost, 7,000 samples), outperforming larger or more resource-intensive models, but length constraints and the multilingual nature of base models pose significant challenges to long-term stability and efficacy. Future work should explore extended training, better language control, and domain generalization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Prolonged training of small LLMs with RL under strict output length constraints (e.g., 4096 tokens) leads to performance degradation and instability, including accuracy drops and multilingual output drift.\n*   A mix of easy and hard problems can improve initial reasoning performance and stabilize early training for small LLMs, but long-term stability remains a challenge under length constraints.\n*   Cosine rewards effectively stabilize output lengths, enhancing training consistency, but may sacrifice peak performance and do not fully resolve issues like multilingual drift without additional measures.\n*   Small LLMs fine-tuned with RL can achieve competitive reasoning performance with significantly reduced data and cost ($42, 7,000 samples) compared to larger or more resource-intensive models.\n*   Output length limitations and the multilingual nature of base models are key challenges for achieving stable and effective reasoning in small LLMs trained with RL.",
