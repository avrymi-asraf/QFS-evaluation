SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates the efficacy of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically a 1.5-billion-parameter model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B), under strict resource constraints. The study adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset. Experiments revealed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) with minimal data (7,000 samples) and low cost ($42), significantly outperforming larger models in terms of resource efficiency. However, challenges such as optimization instability and length constraints emerged with prolonged training. The multilingual nature of the base model also led to language drift, indicating a trade-off when optimizing for monolingual tasks. The findings suggest RL is a viable, cost-effective approach for small LLMs, but careful consideration of data, length limits, and base model characteristics is crucial for sustained performance.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 from 63% to 80%) using RL with minimal data (7,000 samples) and low cost ($42), offering a resource-efficient alternative to larger models.\n*   Prolonged training on small LLMs under strict length constraints can lead to performance degradation and optimization instability.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) can cause language drift when fine-tuning for a monolingual task, even with explicit instructions.\n*   A mix of easy and hard problems, combined with cosine rewards for length control, can improve early performance and training stability, though peak performance might be slightly lower than models trained with more complex reward structures.\n*   The study highlights a trade-off between data efficiency and the depth of reasoning achievable, with longer reasoning chains being particularly challenging under strict token limits.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance reasoning in small LLMs, specifically addressing the challenges of multilingual language drift when fine-tuning for a monolingual task. The study found that while RL can rapidly improve reasoning capabilities in small models (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%), prolonged training and strict length constraints can lead to performance degradation and multilingual language drift. Experiment 1 showed accuracy dropping below baseline after 200 steps with unstable outputs and non-English content. Experiment 2, by mixing easy and hard problems with reduced length limits, improved initial performance but still exhibited late-stage instability and language drift. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to stabilize output lengths, but multilingual tendencies persisted, indicating a need for explicit language control or longer completion lengths for complex tasks. The base model's multilingual nature is identified as a key factor in this drift, posing a trade-off for efficient fine-tuning. Future work suggests mitigating this drift through language-specific rewards or model pre-filtering.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n* Prolonged RL training on small LLMs, especially under strict length constraints, can lead to performance degradation and unintended multilingual language drift.\n* The inherent multilingual nature of the base model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) contributes to language drift, presenting a trade-off when aiming for monolingual reasoning.\n* While a cosine reward helped stabilize output lengths in Experiment 3, it did not fully resolve the multilingual output issue, necessitating explicit language controls or extended completion lengths.\n* The emergence of mixed-language content was observed after approximately 150-200 steps in Experiments 1 and 2, highlighting the challenge of maintaining monolingual focus during extended RL fine-tuning.\n* Future directions include incorporating lightweight language rewards or pre-filtering the base model to mitigate language drift and enhance output consistency for monolingual tasks.",

The primary challenge addressed is managing multilingual language drift when fine-tuning a model for a monolingual reasoning task. Experiments revealed that while RL can rapidly improve reasoning (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%), prolonged training or complex tasks lead to performance degradation and language drift. Specifically, Experiment 1 showed accuracy drops and output issues after 200 steps. Experiment 2, mixing easy and hard problems, improved initial performance but still faced late-stage instability and language drift. Experiment 3, using a cosine reward and an explicit \"English only\" prompt, stabilized output lengths but did not fully resolve the multilingual tendencies inherent in the base model. The study concludes that while RL is effective for small LLMs, the trade-offs of using multilingual base models and the need for extended completion lengths for complex tasks are significant limitations. Future work suggests methods to mitigate language drift and improve stability.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning gains with RL, but prolonged training can lead to performance degradation and language drift.\n*   Using a multilingual base model like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B introduces challenges with monolingual optimization, including unintended language drift.\n*   Explicit instructions (\"English only\") and cosine rewards can help stabilize output length and consistency but do not fully eliminate multilingual tendencies.\n*   Complex reasoning tasks may require longer completion lengths than the 3584-4096 tokens used, contributing to premature truncation and instability.\n*   The research highlights a trade-off: while multilingual models are efficient, they complicate monolingual task adaptation, necessitating strategies to manage language drift.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small LLMs (1.5B parameters) under strict computational constraints using Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically adapting the GRPO algorithm. The core challenge addressed is managing multilingual language drift when fine-tuning for a monolingual reasoning task. Experiments revealed that while small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains within 50-100 training steps, prolonged training leads to performance degradation and language drift, particularly evident in Experiment 1 and 2. Experiment 3 attempted to mitigate this by using a cosine reward for length control and a specific English-only prompt instruction, which stabilized output length but did not entirely eliminate multilingual tendencies. The limitations section explicitly discusses the trade-off of using a multilingual base model, which complicates monolingual optimization and leads to language drift. Future directions suggest incorporating language rewards or monolingual pre-filtering to address this. Despite these challenges, the approach demonstrates a cost-effective and data-efficient method for improving small LLM reasoning, achieving competitive results with minimal resources.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs exhibit rapid reasoning improvements in early training stages (50-100 steps) but face performance degradation and language drift with prolonged training, especially when dealing with complex tasks or strict length constraints.\n*   While a cosine reward and specific English-only prompt instructions in Experiment 3 helped stabilize output length, they did not fully resolve the multilingual language drift issue inherent in the base model.\n*   The use of multilingual base models presents a trade-off: while efficient, they complicate monolingual optimization and can lead to unintended language drift, a key challenge for monolingual reasoning tasks.\n*   The study offers a cost-effective and data-efficient method for enhancing small LLM reasoning, achieving competitive performance with significantly fewer resources than larger models.",

The researchers adapted the GRPO algorithm and a curated mathematical reasoning dataset, aiming to improve performance without relying on large computational resources. They found that RL fine-tuning can lead to rapid reasoning gains, with models achieving significant improvements within 50-100 training steps. However, prolonged training led to performance degradation, optimization instability, and notably, multilingual language drift due to the base model's multilingual nature. Experiment 3 specifically addressed this by using a cosine reward to control output length and an English-only prompt instruction. Despite these efforts, the multilingual tendency persisted. The study highlights a trade-off: while small, multilingual models are resource-efficient, they present challenges in achieving purely monolingual reasoning. Future work suggests incorporating explicit language rewards or pre-filtering to mitigate this drift.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements with RL fine-tuning within 50-100 steps, but prolonged training leads to performance degradation and multilingual language drift.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) complicates the goal of monolingual reasoning, even with English-only prompt instructions.\n*   A cosine reward helped stabilize output lengths, but did not fully resolve the multilingual output issue, suggesting a need for explicit language control or model selection.\n*   The research demonstrates a trade-off between the resource efficiency of smaller, multilingual models and the challenge of maintaining monolingual consistency in their reasoning outputs.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) using Reinforcement Learning (RL) under strict resource constraints, specifically addressing the challenge of multilingual language drift when fine-tuning for a monolingual reasoning task. The researchers fine-tuned a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and a curated mathematical reasoning dataset. Experiments revealed that while small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains within the first 50-100 training steps, prolonged training leads to performance degradation and the emergence of mixed-language outputs due to the base model's multilingual nature. Experiment 3 attempted to mitigate this by using a cosine reward for length control and a specific prompt instruction to favor English, which stabilized output lengths but did not fully eliminate language drift. The limitations highlight a trade-off: using multilingual base models is efficient but complicates monolingual optimization, necessitating future work on explicit language control or longer completion lengths for complex, monolingual tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements with limited data and resources, but prolonged training can lead to performance degradation and multilingual language drift.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) is a key challenge, causing unintended language drift even with English-only prompt instructions.\n*   Cosine rewards help stabilize output lengths, but do not fully resolve language drift; longer completion lengths may be needed for complex reasoning tasks.\n*   The study demonstrates a cost-effective approach ($42) for enhancing small LLM reasoning, but acknowledges the trade-offs inherent in using multilingual foundation models for monolingual tasks.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) using Reinforcement Learning (RL) under strict resource constraints, specifically addressing the challenge of multilingual language drift when fine-tuning for a monolingual reasoning task. The researchers fine-tuned a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and a curated mathematical reasoning dataset. Experiments revealed that while small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains within the first 50-100 training steps, prolonged training leads to performance degradation and the emergence of mixed-language outputs due to the base model's multilingual nature. Experiment 3 attempted to mitigate this by using a cosine reward for length control and a specific prompt instruction to favor English, which stabilized output lengths but did not fully eliminate language drift. The limitations highlight a trade-off: using multilingual base models is efficient but complicates monolingual optimization, necessitating future work on explicit language control or longer completion lengths for complex, monolingual tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements with limited data and resources, but prolonged training can lead to performance degradation and multilingual language drift.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) is a key challenge, causing unintended language drift even with English-only prompt instructions.\n*   Cosine rewards help stabilize output lengths, but do not fully resolve language drift; longer completion lengths may be needed for complex reasoning tasks.\n*   The study demonstrates a cost-effective approach ($42) for enhancing small LLM reasoning, but acknowledges the trade-offs inherent in using multilingual foundation models for monolingual tasks.",
