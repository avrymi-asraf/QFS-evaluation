SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) in improving language model reasoning, particularly focusing on how optimization algorithm artifacts, like the clipping mechanism in GRPO, can create a directional training signal from seemingly pure noise. The research demonstrates that even spurious rewards (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, or format-based rewards) can significantly boost the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Qwen2.5-Math models. This improvement is not due to the informativeness of the reward signal itself, but rather because RLVR, particularly with GRPO's clipping mechanism, amplifies pre-existing reasoning strategies within the model. Specifically, for Qwen2.5-Math models, this often manifests as an increased reliance on \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to assist in problem-solving), which is a latent capability learned during pretraining. The clipping bias in GRPO systematically favors and reinforces these high-prior behaviors, effectively concentrating the model's efforts on its existing strengths, thereby generating a directional signal from otherwise noisy inputs. This effect is model-dependent, with other model families failing to show similar gains with spurious rewards due to a lack of comparable pre-existing reasoning strategies.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Spurious rewards, such as random or incorrect labels, can significantly improve the mathematical reasoning of Qwen2.5-Math models when trained with RLVR.\n*   The GRPO optimization algorithm's clipping mechanism plays a crucial role, creating a directional training signal by amplifying pre-existing reasoning strategies (like code reasoning) that are already present in the model.\n*   This amplification of latent capabilities, rather than learning from the reward signal's content, explains why noisy rewards can be effective for certain models like Qwen2.5-Math.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, as it relies on the model already possessing the beneficial reasoning strategies that the optimization process can elicit.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates how reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can improve mathematical reasoning in language models, even when using \"spurious\" or noisy reward signals. The core of the user's query lies in understanding the role of optimization algorithm artifacts, specifically the clipping mechanism in GRPO, in creating a directional training signal from pure noise. The research finds that while spurious rewards like random or incorrect labels can significantly boost performance in Qwen2.5-Math models, they often fail to generalize to other model families. A key finding is that the GRPO algorithm's clipping mechanism plays a crucial role in this phenomenon. Even with random rewards (effectively pure noise), the clipping bias in GRPO can create a directional training signal by reinforcing the model's pre-existing behaviors, particularly \"code reasoning\" in the case of Qwen2.5-Math models. This bias encourages the model to stick to its high-probability, learned patterns, which for Qwen2.5-Math, happen to correlate with improved reasoning. When this clipping bias is removed, random rewards no longer reliably improve performance, highlighting its importance in transforming noise into a usable signal.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The GRPO algorithm's clipping mechanism can generate a directional training signal from random (noisy) rewards by reinforcing a model's pre-existing behavioral patterns.\n*   For Qwen2.5-Math models, this mechanism amplifies \"code reasoning,\" a strategy learned during pre-training that correlates with higher accuracy.\n*   When the clipping mechanism is disabled, random rewards generally fail to produce reliable performance improvements, demonstrating its critical role.\n*   The effectiveness of this process is highly model-dependent, as it relies on the pre-existing, high-probability behaviors of the model to correlate with correctness.",

The research highlights that the GRPO optimization algorithm, specifically its clipping mechanism, plays a crucial role in transforming these weak signals into a directional training signal. When applied to Qwen2.5-Math models, random rewards (essentially pure noise) can still lead to significant performance gains. This phenomenon is attributed to the clipping mechanism in GRPO, which, rather than directly using the noisy reward, biases the updates to reinforce the model's pre-existing, high-probability behaviors. For Qwen2.5-Math, a key pre-existing behavior is \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid mathematical problem-solving). The clipping bias amplifies this code reasoning, which strongly correlates with correctness, thereby creating a meaningful training signal from noise. This effect is model-dependent, with other models lacking such strong pre-existing reasoning patterns not benefiting similarly from spurious rewards.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The clipping mechanism in the GRPO optimization algorithm is identified as a key factor enabling spurious rewards to generate a directional training signal.\n*   Random rewards, representing pure noise, can still lead to significant performance improvements in Qwen2.5-Math models due to GRPO's clipping bias amplifying pre-existing behaviors.\n*   \"Code reasoning\" (using Python for mathematical problem-solving) is a pre-existing behavior in Qwen2.5-Math models that strongly correlates with correctness and is effectively amplified by the clipping bias, even with noisy rewards.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, as the clipping bias only benefits models that possess pre-existing reasoning patterns that correlate with correctness.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how optimization algorithm artifacts, particularly the clipping mechanism in GRPO, contribute to creating a directional training signal from pure noise in Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). The study reveals that the clipping bias within GRPO systematically favors and amplifies a model's pre-existing high-probability behaviors. This bias is crucial for generating a meaningful training signal even when the reward signal is random (i.e., pure noise). For Qwen2.5-Math models, which exhibit a strong pre-existing tendency for \"code reasoning\" (using Python code to assist mathematical thinking), this clipping bias effectively upweights this beneficial behavior, leading to significant performance gains on math reasoning tasks. In contrast, models lacking such strong, correctness-correlated prior behaviors do not benefit from this mechanism, as the clipping bias has no useful pattern to amplify. This highlights that the effectiveness of spurious rewards and the optimization algorithm's role are highly dependent on the specific pre-trained capabilities of the model. The findings underscore the importance of testing RLVR across diverse models and reward types, as effects observed in one model family may not generalize.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The clipping mechanism in GRPO introduces a \"clipping bias\" that systematically favors and amplifies a model's pre-existing high-probability behaviors.\n*   This clipping bias allows random rewards (pure noise) to generate a directional training signal by upweighting behaviors that correlate with correctness, particularly \"code reasoning\" in Qwen2.5-Math models.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards and the clipping mechanism is highly model-dependent, relying on the presence of beneficial pre-existing reasoning strategies (e.g., code reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math).\n*   Models without strong, correctness-correlated prior behaviors do not benefit from this bias, as there are no useful patterns for the algorithm to amplify.\n*   RLVR research should be validated on diverse models, as observed effects with spurious rewards are not generalizable due to differences in pre-trained reasoning strategies.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates how optimization algorithm artifacts, specifically the clipping mechanism in GRPO, can create a directional training signal from pure noise like random rewards. The study reveals that GRPO's clipping mechanism introduces a bias that favors pre-existing, high-probability behaviors within a model. This bias is crucial for generating training signals from random rewards, as it systematically amplifies the model's prior knowledge. For Qwen2.5-Math models, this often translates to amplifying \"code reasoning,\" a strategy learned during pre-training that correlates with higher accuracy. This amplification explains why random rewards can significantly improve Qwen2.5-Math's performance, while failing to do so for models lacking such pre-existing, beneficial reasoning patterns. The effectiveness of spurious rewards is thus highly model-dependent, highlighting the critical role of pre-training data and learned strategies in RLVR outcomes. This also implies that RLVR research should be validated on diverse models, as findings on one family, like Qwen, may not generalize.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   GRPO's clipping mechanism creates a \"clipping bias\" that systematically favors and amplifies a model's pre-existing, high-probability behaviors.\n*   This clipping bias enables random rewards to generate a directional training signal by concentrating the model's output distribution on its most frequent (and potentially useful) pre-trained reasoning strategies, such as code reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, relying on the presence of pre-existing reasoning strategies that correlate with correctness; Qwen2.5-Math benefits due to its strong code reasoning prior, while other models do not.\n*   RLVR research findings, particularly those using spurious rewards, should be validated across diverse model families due to the significant impact of pre-training on RLVR outcomes.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates how optimization algorithm artifacts, specifically the clipping mechanism in GRPO, can create a directional training signal from pure noise, particularly in the context of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). The research demonstrates that while spurious rewards (like random or incorrect labels) can significantly improve Qwen2.5-Math models' performance, they fail to generalize to other model families. This discrepancy is attributed to pre-existing reasoning strategies within the models. Qwen2.5-Math models, notably, exhibit a strong tendency towards \"code reasoning\" (using Python to aid mathematical problem-solving), which is highly correlated with accuracy. The GRPO clipping mechanism plays a crucial role by amplifying these pre-existing, high-probability behaviors. When applied with random rewards, the clipping bias creates an asymmetric update, favoring tokens that are already highly probable in the model's prior distribution. This effectively concentrates the model's focus on its existing strengths, such as code reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math, thus generating a useful training signal even from noisy rewards. Ablation studies confirm that disabling clipping negates the performance gains from random rewards, highlighting the critical role of this algorithmic artifact in shaping RLVR outcomes.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The GRPO clipping mechanism can generate a directional training signal from random noise by amplifying pre-existing, high-probability behaviors within a model.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models benefit from spurious rewards due to their strong pre-existing \"code reasoning\" strategy, which correlates with higher accuracy.\n*   Disabling the GRPO clipping mechanism eliminates the performance gains observed with random rewards, underscoring its importance in creating a signal from noise.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is model-dependent, as it relies on the specific reasoning strategies learned during pre-training, which are not transferable to all model families.\n*   RLVR research should be validated on diverse models to avoid conclusions drawn from model-specific pre-training influences.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates how optimization algorithm artifacts, specifically the clipping mechanism in GRPO, can generate a directional training signal from pure noise (random rewards). The research found that GRPO's clipping mechanism introduces a bias that systematically favors and amplifies pre-existing behaviors within a model. This bias is crucial for generating effective training signals from random rewards. The study highlights that this mechanism is model-dependent: it successfully enhances performance in Qwen2.5-Math models by amplifying their strong pre-existing \"code reasoning\" strategy, which correlates with correctness. In contrast, models lacking this specific pre-trained behavior, like Llama or OLMo, do not benefit from random rewards, even with the clipping bias. The paper concludes that the effectiveness of spurious rewards in RLVR is largely due to their ability to elicit beneficial pre-trained strategies, and that the clipping mechanism in GRPO plays a key role in this elicitation process when the reward signal itself is uninformative. This has significant implications for RLVR research, emphasizing the need for cross-model validation and understanding the role of pre-training.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   GRPO's clipping mechanism creates a \"clipping bias\" that amplifies pre-existing model behaviors, enabling training signals from random (noisy) rewards.\n*   This bias is model-dependent: it benefits Qwen2.5-Math models by amplifying their \"code reasoning\" strategy, which correlates with correctness.\n*   Models lacking such effective pre-trained strategies (e.g., Llama, OLMo) do not benefit from random rewards, even with the clipping bias.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards in RLVR is primarily due to their ability to elicit beneficial, pre-existing reasoning patterns, with the clipping mechanism being key to this process.\n*   The findings underscore the importance of pre-training on RLVR outcomes and the need for testing across diverse models.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how optimization algorithm artifacts, specifically the clipping mechanism in GRPO, can create a directional training signal from pure noise, as demonstrated through the use of random rewards in Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). The study reveals that GRPO's clipping bias systematically favors and amplifies pre-existing behaviors within a model. For Qwen2.5-Math models, which possess a strong prior for \"code reasoning\" (using Python to aid mathematical problem-solving), this clipping bias effectively concentrates the model's attention on this beneficial strategy, leading to significant performance improvements even with random rewards. This mechanism explains why spurious rewards work for Qwen models but not for others lacking such pre-trained code reasoning capabilities. The effectiveness of RLVR with noisy rewards is thus heavily contingent on the model's pre-existing, beneficial reasoning patterns, underscoring the importance of model diversity in RLVR research.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   GRPO's clipping mechanism generates a training signal from random (noisy) rewards by amplifying pre-existing model behaviors.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models benefit from this clipping bias because their pre-training includes a strong \"code reasoning\" capability that correlates with correctness.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards in RLVR is model-dependent, relying on the presence of beneficial pre-trained reasoning strategies like code reasoning.\n*   Random rewards, when combined with GRPO's clipping bias, can elicit significant performance gains by focusing the model on its dominant, correct reasoning patterns.\n*   RLVR research should be validated on diverse models, as effects observed with Qwen models (due to their specific pre-training) do not generalize to others.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates how optimization algorithm artifacts, specifically the clipping mechanism in GRPO, can create a directional training signal from pure noise, particularly in the context of RLVR for language models. The research highlights that GRPO's clipping bias can amplify pre-existing behaviors within a model, even when the reward signal is random noise. This amplification leads to performance gains by reinforcing dominant, high-probability behaviors learned during pre-training. The study demonstrates that this mechanism is highly model-dependent. Qwen2.5-Math models, which exhibit strong \"code reasoning\" (using Python for mathematical thought) as a pre-trained strategy, benefit significantly from this clipping-induced signal. In contrast, models lacking such effective pre-trained reasoning strategies do not see similar gains, as the clipping bias has no beneficial pre-existing behavior to amplify. This explains why spurious rewards can elicit performance improvements in Qwen2.5-Math but fail to generalize to other model families, underscoring the critical role of pre-training in determining RLVR outcomes.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   GRPO's clipping mechanism can generate a non-zero training signal from random rewards by amplifying pre-existing, high-probability behaviors within a model.\n*   This amplification is model-dependent: Qwen2.5-Math models benefit due to their strong pre-trained \"code reasoning\" strategy, which correlates with performance.\n*   Other models lacking effective pre-trained reasoning strategies do not benefit from random rewards with clipping, as there are no useful patterns to amplify.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards in RLVR is largely determined by the model's pre-training, not the informativeness of the reward signal itself.\n*   Empirical validation through clipping ablation demonstrates that clipping bias is crucial for random rewards to drive performance gains in Qwen2.5-Math models.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how optimization algorithm artifacts, specifically the clipping mechanism in GRPO, can generate a directional training signal from pure noise, enabling reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to improve model performance even with spurious rewards. The study reveals that GRPO's clipping bias creates an asymmetric update mechanism, favoring and amplifying pre-existing behaviors within a model. For Qwen2.5-Math models, this bias effectively upweights \"code reasoning\"—a pre-trained strategy that correlates with higher accuracy. This amplification allows random or incorrect rewards, which are otherwise uninformative, to drive significant performance gains by reinforcing this specific reasoning pattern. However, this effect is highly model-dependent; models without such pre-existing, beneficial reasoning strategies do not benefit from this clipping bias, highlighting the crucial role of pre-training in RLVR success. The findings underscore the importance of testing RLVR across diverse models to understand the interaction between optimization artifacts and model-specific priors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   GRPO's clipping mechanism introduces a bias that systematically amplifies pre-existing model behaviors, effectively creating a training signal even from random noise.\n*   For Qwen2.5-Math models, this clipping bias specifically upweights \"code reasoning,\" a pre-trained strategy that correlates with improved mathematical accuracy, leading to performance gains with spurious rewards.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards and the clipping bias is highly model-dependent, relying on the presence of beneficial pre-trained reasoning strategies; models lacking these do not benefit.\n*   Empirical validation through ablation studies demonstrates that disabling the clipping mechanism in GRPO eliminates the performance gains observed with random rewards, confirming its critical role.\n*   The research emphasizes that RLVR success is strongly tied to the model's pre-training, and effects observed in one model family may not generalize to others due to differences in learned reasoning strategies.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how optimization algorithm artifacts, specifically the clipping mechanism in GRPO, can generate a directional training signal from pure noise, enabling reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to improve model performance even with spurious rewards. The study reveals that GRPO's clipping bias creates an asymmetric update mechanism, favoring and amplifying pre-existing behaviors within a model. For Qwen2.5-Math models, this bias effectively upweights \"code reasoning\"—a pre-trained strategy that correlates with higher accuracy. This amplification allows random or incorrect rewards, which are otherwise uninformative, to drive significant performance gains by reinforcing this specific reasoning pattern. However, this effect is highly model-dependent; models without such pre-existing, beneficial reasoning strategies do not benefit from this clipping bias, highlighting the crucial role of pre-training in RLVR success. The findings underscore the importance of testing RLVR across diverse models to understand the interaction between optimization artifacts and model-specific priors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   GRPO's clipping mechanism introduces a bias that systematically amplifies pre-existing model behaviors, effectively creating a training signal even from random noise.\n*   For Qwen2.5-Math models, this clipping bias specifically upweights \"code reasoning,\" a pre-trained strategy that correlates with improved mathematical accuracy, leading to performance gains with spurious rewards.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards and the clipping bias is highly model-dependent, relying on the presence of beneficial pre-trained reasoning strategies; models lacking these do not benefit.\n*   Empirical validation through ablation studies demonstrates that disabling the clipping mechanism in GRPO eliminates the performance gains observed with random rewards, confirming its critical role.\n*   The research emphasizes that RLVR success is strongly tied to the model's pre-training, and effects observed in one model family may not generalize to others due to differences in learned reasoning strategies.",
