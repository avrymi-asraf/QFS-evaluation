SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a novel student embedding model designed through a multi-stage distillation process from larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models like NV-Embed-v2 and Stella. The core of this framework is a self-distillation mechanism for post-hoc modality alignment, particularly in Stage 4, where visual embeddings are aligned with textual embeddings. This alignment is achieved by using the text embeddings as teacher signals for the image embeddings. The distillation employs three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss, which progressively transfer knowledge from teachers to the student. To address the challenge of high vector dimensionality in SOTA models, the research also incorporates Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for effective dimensionality reduction. Jasper, with 2 billion parameters, demonstrates performance comparable to 7 billion parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, showcasing the efficacy of this distillation approach for both knowledge transfer and cross-modal alignment.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper utilizes a multi-stage distillation framework to transfer knowledge from multiple SOTA teacher embedding models to a smaller student model.\n*   A self-distillation mechanism is employed in Stage 4 to align visual embeddings with textual embeddings, enabling preliminary multimodal capabilities.\n*   The distillation process leverages three distinct loss functions (cosine, similarity, and relative similarity) to guide the student model's learning.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is integrated to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model.\n*   Jasper achieves performance competitive with larger models (7B parameters) despite having only 2B parameters, validating the distillation strategy.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, developed using a multi-stage distillation framework from multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models like Stella. The core of the approach involves knowledge distillation through three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss for absolute representation alignment, similarity loss for semantic pair-wise consistency, and relative similarity distillation loss to preserve ranking preferences. Stage 3 of the training process specifically utilizes Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for effective dimension reduction, employing self-distillation where aligned vectors from earlier stages act as teachers for the reduced-dimension outputs. Stage 4 focuses on unlocking multimodal capabilities by training the vision encoder using image-caption pairs, with caption embeddings serving as teacher vectors and image embeddings as student vectors. While this stage achieves preliminary text-image alignment, it is noted as having significant room for improvement. The Jasper model achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard.\n\n2.

The core of the methodology is a multi-stage distillation process employing three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. These losses progressively transfer knowledge from teachers to the student, moving from specific to broader semantic alignments. Notably, Stage 3 incorporates Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for effective dimension reduction, utilizing a self-distillation approach where earlier student model outputs serve as teachers for lower-dimensional projections. Stage 4 attempts preliminary multimodal alignment using self-distillation, where text embeddings act as teachers for image embeddings, although this stage is acknowledged to have significant room for improvement. The Jasper model, built upon Stella, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating the efficacy of this distillation strategy.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a multi-stage distillation framework with cosine, similarity, and relative similarity loss functions to learn from multiple large teacher models.\n*   Stage 3 utilizes Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) and self-distillation to reduce the student model's vector dimensionality, using internal model outputs as teachers.\n*   Stage 4 performs preliminary multimodal alignment via self-distillation, treating text embeddings as teachers for image embeddings, but acknowledges limitations and future improvement needs.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to larger 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of the distillation approach.\n*   The model architecture includes a language model encoder, a vision encoder, a pooler, and fully connected layers for projection.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, achieved through a multi-stage distillation framework from larger state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like Stella and NV-Embed-v2. The core methodology involves three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (semantic matching from text-pair perspective), and relative similarity distillation loss (leveraging relative ranking). Initially, Jasper's vector dimension is increased to 12288 by concatenating teacher outputs. Stage 3 employs Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional FC layers for dimension reduction, using the 12288-dim vectors as self-distillation teachers for shorter vectors. Stage 4 focuses on multimodal capabilities by training a vision encoder using image-caption pairs via self-distillation, where caption embeddings act as teachers for image embeddings.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art performance by distilling knowledge from multiple larger teacher models. The core of their methodology involves a multi-stage distillation framework using three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (semantic matching from text-pair perspective), and relative similarity distillation loss (leveraging relative ranking). Stage 3 incorporates Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for effective vector dimensionality reduction, even proposing self-distillation where earlier student outputs act as teachers for reduced dimensions. Stage 4 focuses on multimodal alignment, specifically training the vision encoder using self-distillation with text embeddings as teachers, though this stage is noted as a preliminary alignment with significant room for future improvement. Jasper, built on the Stella model, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a multi-stage distillation process using cosine, similarity, and relative similarity losses to transfer knowledge from multiple large teacher models.\n*   Stage 3 utilizes Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for dimensionality reduction, with an exploration of self-distillation where student outputs become teachers for reduced dimensions.\n*   Stage 4 uses self-distillation to align vision and text embeddings, training only the vision encoder while freezing other components.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard.\n*   Future work aims to significantly enhance the multimodal capabilities and vision encoding, acknowledging current limitations in Stage 4.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art performance comparable to larger 7 billion parameter models by employing a multi-stage distillation framework. The core of this framework involves a student model learning from multiple larger teacher models through three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. These losses progressively transfer knowledge from specific to broader semantic relationships. To address the high dimensionality of concatenated teacher embeddings, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized in Stage 3 for effective dimension reduction. Stage 4 focuses on unlocking multimodal potential by training a vision encoder using a self-distillation approach, where text embeddings act as teacher signals for image embeddings. While this stage provides preliminary alignment, significant room for improvement in vision encoding is acknowledged, with future work planned to enhance multimodal capabilities. Jasper's robust performance on the MTEB leaderboard demonstrates the effectiveness of this distillation strategy.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper presents Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, developed using a multi-stage distillation framework to learn from larger, state-of-the-art teacher models like NV-Embed-v2 and Stella. The methodology employs three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (semantic matching from a text-pair perspective), and relative similarity distillation loss (leveraging relative ranking). Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized for effective dimension reduction. A key aspect is Stage 4, where a self-distillation mechanism is introduced for post-hoc modality alignment, training the vision encoder using text embeddings as teacher signals. While this stage achieves preliminary alignment, limitations in vision encoding are acknowledged, with future work planned for enhancement. Jasper demonstrates performance comparable to 7B models on the MTEB leaderboard, significantly outperforming other models in its size class.\n\n2.

The core of their methodology is a multi-stage distillation framework. In Stage 1 and 2, Jasper learns from multiple large teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella) using three carefully designed losses: cosine loss (aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (semantic matching from text-pair perspective), and relative similarity distillation loss (leveraging relative ranking). Stage 3 employs Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) and a self-distillation approach, where intermediate student outputs act as teachers, to reduce vector dimensionality effectively. Stage 4 focuses on multimodal capabilities by training a vision encoder using self-distillation, aligning image embeddings with textual embeddings derived from captions. While this provides preliminary alignment, the paper acknowledges limitations and outlines future work for significant vision enhancement. The Jasper model, built upon Stella, secured the No. 3 position on the MTEB leaderboard.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper utilizes a multi-stage distillation process with cosine, similarity, and relative similarity losses to transfer knowledge from larger teacher models.\n*   Stage 3 employs MRL and self-distillation (using intermediate student outputs as teachers) for effective vector dimensionality reduction.\n*   Stage 4 uses self-distillation to align a vision encoder with textual embeddings, though this is noted as a preliminary step with room for improvement.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to 7B models and ranks No. 3 on the MTEB leaderboard.\n*   The model architecture includes a language model, vision encoder, pooler, and FC layers, with Stage 4 training focusing on the vision encoder while other components are frozen.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance by distilling knowledge from multiple larger teacher models (Stella and NV-Embed-v2) using a novel multi-stage framework. The methodology employs three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss for absolute representation alignment, similarity loss for semantic matching between text pairs, and relative similarity distillation loss to capture ranking preferences. Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is used in Stage 3 to effectively reduce vector dimensionality. Stage 4 focuses on unlocking multimodal capabilities by integrating a vision encoder and using self-distillation to align visual embeddings with textual embeddings. Jasper's performance on the MTEB leaderboard is comparable to 7B parameter models, demonstrating the effectiveness of this distillation approach. The authors also highlight the robustness of Jasper to different instructions and discuss potential improvements for vision encoding in future work.\n\n2.
