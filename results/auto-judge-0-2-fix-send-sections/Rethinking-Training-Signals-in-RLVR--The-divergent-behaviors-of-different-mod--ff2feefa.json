The research highlights a fundamental lack of technique generalization in RLVR. While RLVR, even with spurious rewards (like incorrect labels or random rewards), significantly improves mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, these same techniques fail to yield similar gains on Llama3 or OLMo2 models. This divergence suggests that RLVR's success is heavily dependent on the model's pre-training, with Qwen models exhibiting a unique ability to leverage \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for mathematical thought processes) that is effectively amplified by RLVR. In contrast, other models either show minimal improvement or even degrade with spurious rewards, indicating that the underlying reasoning strategies learned during pre-training do not generalize across different model architectures or training methodologies. The study concludes that future RLVR research needs to be validated on diverse models to understand these behavioral differences.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR training with spurious rewards significantly boosts performance in Qwen2.5-Math models but shows minimal to negative gains on Llama3 and OLMo2 models.\n*   This performance disparity indicates a lack of generalizability for RLVR techniques across different model families.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a distinctive \"code reasoning\" behavior that is effectively amplified by RLVR, correlating with improved accuracy.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is heavily influenced by the model's pre-training, suggesting that RLVR primarily elicits existing capabilities rather than teaching new ones.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse model architectures to account for these observed differences in technique generalization.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and reveals a significant lack of technique generalization across different model families, particularly highlighting the divergent behaviors of Qwen, Llama, and OLMo models under identical RLVR training. The research demonstrates that while spurious rewards (e.g., incorrect labels, random rewards, format-only rewards) can elicit substantial performance gains in Qwen2.5-Math models, these same rewards often fail to improve, or even degrade, the performance of Llama and OLMo models. This divergence is attributed to underlying differences in pre-training, with Qwen models exhibiting a unique \"code reasoning\" capability (using Python for thought processes without execution) that is effectively amplified by RLVR, even with weak or noisy signals. This code reasoning proficiency, absent or less effective in other models, is identified as a key factor in why Qwen models benefit from spurious rewards while others do not. The study also delves into the GRPO clipping bias as a mechanism that can surface these pre-existing capabilities, explaining how random rewards can induce learning.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Spurious rewards yield significant performance gains on Qwen2.5-Math models but fail to generalize to Llama and OLMo models, indicating a lack of technique generalization.\n*   Qwen models possess a unique \"code reasoning\" capability (generating Python for thought), which RLVR effectively amplifies, leading to performance improvements even with weak or random rewards.\n*   The GRPO clipping bias is identified as a mechanism that exploits pre-existing model behaviors, explaining how random rewards can induce learning by amplifying dominant, often correct, reasoning strategies.\n*   Experimental interventions confirm a causal link between increased code reasoning frequency and performance gains in Qwen models, while such interventions degrade or yield no gains in other model families.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR techniques is heavily dependent on the base model's pre-training, highlighting the need to validate findings across diverse model architectures.",

A key finding is that while RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models even with spurious rewards (e.g., incorrect labels, random rewards), these same rewards largely fail to yield gains in other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2. This divergence highlights a fundamental lack of technique generalization. The study attributes this to differences in pre-training, particularly Qwen2.5-Math's strong predisposition towards \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for problem-solving without execution). RLVR appears to amplify this pre-existing capability, leading to performance improvements. Conversely, models like OLMo2, lacking this specific pre-trained reasoning strategy, do not benefit from spurious rewards. The paper also explores the role of GRPO clipping bias in enabling random rewards to provide training signals by exploiting existing model priors, further underscoring the dependence on pre-training.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards significantly improves Qwen2.5-Math models but not Llama3 or OLMo2, indicating a lack of technique generalization.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong pre-trained \"code reasoning\" behavior, which RLVR amplifies, leading to performance gains even with uninformative rewards.\n*   GRPO's clipping bias can create training signals from random rewards by exploiting existing model priors, explaining their efficacy on models like Qwen2.5-Math.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is heavily dependent on the model's pre-training, with Qwen models showing unique robustness due to specific reasoning strategies.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and reveals a significant lack of technique generalization across different model families. Specifically, spurious rewards that dramatically improve Qwen2.5-Math model performance (e.g., incorrect labels, random rewards) fail to yield comparable gains for Llama3 and OLMo models. This divergence is attributed to pre-training differences; Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong \"code reasoning\" capability (generating Python code to aid in mathematical problem-solving), which is effectively elicited by RLVR even with weak or random rewards. In contrast, other models either don't possess this capability or use it detrimentally (\"Bad-Code\" models). The study also identifies GRPO's clipping bias as a mechanism that can create training signals from random rewards by amplifying pre-existing behaviors. The findings emphasize that RLVR's effectiveness is heavily dependent on the base model's pre-trained capabilities, urging for validation across diverse model architectures rather than relying on a single de facto choice like Qwen.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels) significantly improve Qwen2.5-Math model performance through RLVR, but these gains do not generalize to Llama3 or OLMo models.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a distinctive \"code reasoning\" ability, which RLVR effectively elicits and correlates with performance improvements, a capability absent or detrimental in other tested models.\n*   GRPO's clipping bias can generate training signals from random rewards by amplifying pre-existing model behaviors, explaining why random rewards work for Qwen models but not others lacking similar pre-trained capabilities.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR techniques is strongly influenced by the model's pre-training, highlighting the need for diverse model validation beyond Qwen.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and reveals a fundamental issue of technique generalization across different model families. While RLVR, even with spurious rewards (e.g., incorrect labels, random rewards, or format adherence), significantly improves mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, these gains do not transfer to other families like Llama3 or OLMo2. These latter models show minimal or even negative performance changes, indicating that the effectiveness of RLVR is heavily dependent on the model's pre-training. Specifically, Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capability (generating Python code for thought processes), which RLVR effectively amplifies, leading to performance boosts. In contrast, \"Bad-Code\" models like OLMo2-7B-SFT attempt code reasoning but perform worse, and \"No-Code\" models lack this ability entirely. The study also highlights that the GRPO optimization algorithm's clipping bias can create training signals even from random rewards, further emphasizing how RLVR can amplify existing, potentially spurious, model behaviors rather than teaching new ones. This divergence underscores the need to validate RLVR techniques on diverse model architectures and pre-training strategies.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards significantly improves Qwen2.5-Math models but fails to generalize to Llama3 and OLMo2 models, indicating a lack of technique generalization.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capability, which RLVR effectively amplifies, leading to performance gains, a pattern not observed in other model families.\n*   The GRPO algorithm's clipping bias can generate meaningful training signals from random rewards, reinforcing existing model behaviors, which explains why spurious rewards work for Qwen but not for models lacking specific pre-trained reasoning strategies.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR is heavily influenced by the model's pre-training, with Qwen models demonstrating a unique robustness to spurious rewards due to their learned reasoning patterns.\n*   Researchers are cautioned to validate RLVR findings across diverse model families, as conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models may not be representative of the technique's broader applicability.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness across different model families. A key finding is the stark divergence in how various models (Qwen, Llama, OLMo) respond to identical RLVR training signals, particularly \"spurious rewards\" (e.g., random or incorrect rewards). While Qwen models, especially Qwen2.5-Math, show significant performance gains (up to ~29% on MATH-500) even with these weak signals, Llama and OLMo models exhibit minimal or even negative improvements. This highlights a fundamental lack of technique generalization in RLVR. The study posits that Qwen models' pre-training, which instilled strong \"code reasoning\" capabilities (generating Python code for problem-solving), allows RLVR to effectively elicit these pre-existing skills, even with noisy rewards. Conversely, models lacking this specific pre-trained capability do not benefit. The paper emphasizes that RLVR research conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models may not be generalizable, urging validation on diverse model architectures.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards (random, incorrect labels, format) significantly improves Qwen models' mathematical reasoning (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-7B gains up to 29.1% on MATH-500).\n*   These same spurious rewards yield minimal or negative performance gains on other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, demonstrating a lack of generalization.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capability (generating Python for math), which RLVR effectively elicits, driving performance improvements.\n*   Models lacking effective code reasoning pre-training do not benefit from RLVR with spurious rewards, indicating that the technique amplifies existing, relevant capabilities.\n*   The research strongly advises validating RLVR findings on diverse model families, not just Qwen, due to observed differences in response to training signals.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness across different model families, specifically highlighting a fundamental lack of technique generalization. The study found that while RLVR, even with spurious rewards (like incorrect labels or random signals), significantly improves mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, these benefits do not transfer to other model families such as Llama3 and OLMo2. These non-Qwen models show minimal or even negative improvements with spurious rewards. This divergence is attributed to pre-training differences, with Qwen models exhibiting a strong pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capability (generating Python code to aid mathematical thought without execution), which RLVR effectively amplifies. The GRPO clipping bias in the optimization algorithm is identified as a key mechanism that enables random rewards to elicit these pre-existing behaviors, particularly in Qwen models. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for RLVR research to be validated on diverse models, as Qwen models' unique robustness to spurious rewards creates a misleading impression of general technique efficacy.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards significantly improves Qwen2.5-Math models, but these gains do not generalize to Llama3 or OLMo2 models, indicating a lack of technique generalization.\n*   Qwen models exhibit a distinct pre-training behavior of \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for mathematical thought), which RLVR effectively leverages for performance gains, a behavior not observed or less effective in other model families.\n*   The GRPO clipping bias is identified as a mechanism that allows random rewards to provide training signals by amplifying pre-existing model behaviors, particularly benefiting Qwen models' code reasoning.\n*   The study strongly suggests that future RLVR research should be validated on diverse model architectures to avoid drawing conclusions based on the specific, and often non-generalizable, behaviors of models like Qwen.",

A key finding is the significant performance gains observed in Qwen2.5-Math models even with spurious or weak reward signals (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format rewards). These gains are attributed to RLVR's ability to elicit pre-existing reasoning capabilities, particularly \"code reasoning\" (using Python for mathematical thinking), which is prevalent in Qwen2.5-Math models (65% pre-RLVR, >90% post-RLVR). However, this technique shows a fundamental lack of generalization to other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2. These models exhibit minimal or negative improvements with spurious rewards, indicating that their pre-training data and learned reasoning strategies do not align with what these weak signals can elicit. The study also details the role of GRPO's clipping bias in enabling random rewards to create training signals by amplifying existing model behaviors, a mechanism that is model-dependent. The paper concludes with a strong caution that RLVR research conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models may not be representative of the broader landscape due to this stark lack of technique generalization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards significantly boosts Qwen2.5-Math model performance by eliciting pre-existing \"code reasoning,\" but this effect does not generalize to Llama3 or OLMo2 models.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math-7B exhibits high pre-RLVR code reasoning frequency (65%), which increases to over 90% post-RLVR, correlating strongly with accuracy gains.\n*   GRPO's clipping bias is identified as a mechanism that allows random rewards to create training signals by amplifying existing model behaviors, explaining the model-specific efficacy.\n*   The study highlights a fundamental lack of technique generalization in RLVR, warning against drawing conclusions solely from Qwen models.\n*   Qwen models demonstrate a unique robustness to weak or spurious reward signals, likely due to their pre-training data favoring specific reasoning strategies like code reasoning.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and highlights a significant lack of technique generalization across different model families. The study found that while RLVR, even with spurious rewards (e.g., incorrect labels, random signals), can dramatically improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, these same techniques often fail to yield gains or even degrade performance in other models like Llama3 and OLMo2. This divergence is attributed to pre-training differences, particularly Qwen2.5-Math's predisposition for \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for problem-solving without execution), which RLVR effectively upweights. The paper also explores the GRPO clipping bias as a mechanism that allows random rewards to surface these pre-existing, beneficial behaviors in Qwen models. The findings underscore the critical need to validate RLVR techniques on diverse model architectures, rather than relying on Qwen models as a de facto standard, due to the strong model-specific nature of RLVR effectiveness.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR, even with spurious rewards, significantly improves Qwen2.5-Math models by eliciting pre-existing reasoning patterns like code reasoning.\n*   These RLVR techniques and spurious rewards generally fail to generalize to other model families such as Llama3 and OLMo2, indicating a lack of technique transferability.\n*   The Qwen2.5-Math models' unique susceptibility to spurious rewards is linked to their strong pre-trained \"code reasoning\" capability, which RLVR effectively amplifies.\n*   GRPO's clipping bias is identified as a mechanism that enables random rewards to surface and upweight these pre-existing, beneficial reasoning strategies in models like Qwen.\n*   The research strongly cautions against drawing general conclusions about RLVR from Qwen-centric experiments, emphasizing the necessity of validation across diverse model architectures due to significant model-dependent performance variations.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its efficacy across different model families, highlighting a significant lack of technique generalization. The study found that while RLVR, even with \"spurious\" rewards (like incorrect labels or random signals), can dramatically improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-7B), these gains do not transfer to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2. For instance, Qwen2.5-Math-7B saw substantial improvements (e.g., +21.4% with random rewards, +24.1% with incorrect labels), often nearing the gains from ground truth rewards (+29.1%). In contrast, Llama3 and OLMo2 models showed minimal or even negative performance changes with spurious rewards. This divergence is attributed to pre-training differences, with Qwen2.5-Math models exhibiting a strong pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capability (generating Python code for reasoning) that RLVR effectively amplifies, even with noisy signals. The research emphasizes that conclusions drawn from Qwen-centric RLVR studies may not be generalizable.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards significantly boosts Qwen2.5-Math model performance (e.g., +21.4% with random rewards), but fails to generalize to Llama3 or OLMo2 models.\n*   This lack of generalization is linked to pre-training differences, particularly Qwen models' pre-existing \"code reasoning\" ability, which RLVR effectively amplifies.\n*   GRPO's clipping bias is identified as a mechanism that can generate training signals from random rewards by amplifying pre-existing model behaviors.\n*   The study warns against drawing broad conclusions from Qwen-centric RLVR research, stressing the need for validation across diverse model families.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its efficacy across different model families, highlighting a significant lack of technique generalization. The study found that while RLVR, even with \"spurious\" rewards (like incorrect labels or random signals), can dramatically improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-7B), these gains do not transfer to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2. For instance, Qwen2.5-Math-7B saw substantial improvements (e.g., +21.4% with random rewards, +24.1% with incorrect labels), often nearing the gains from ground truth rewards (+29.1%). In contrast, Llama3 and OLMo2 models showed minimal or even negative performance changes with spurious rewards. This divergence is attributed to pre-training differences, with Qwen2.5-Math models exhibiting a strong pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capability (generating Python code for reasoning) that RLVR effectively amplifies, even with noisy signals. The research emphasizes that conclusions drawn from Qwen-centric RLVR studies may not be generalizable.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards significantly boosts Qwen2.5-Math model performance (e.g., +21.4% with random rewards), but fails to generalize to Llama3 or OLMo2 models.\n*   This lack of generalization is linked to pre-training differences, particularly Qwen models' pre-existing \"code reasoning\" ability, which RLVR effectively amplifies.\n*   GRPO's clipping bias is identified as a mechanism that can generate training signals from random rewards by amplifying pre-existing model behaviors.\n*   The study warns against drawing broad conclusions from Qwen-centric RLVR research, stressing the need for validation across diverse model families.",
