      "summary": "The article \"Learn Beyond The Answer: Training Language Models with Reflection for Mathematical Reasoning\" introduces a novel training technique called \"reflective augmentation\" (RefAug) designed to enhance language models' (LMs) mathematical reasoning skills. Unlike traditional data augmentation methods that primarily expand the training dataset with more problems, RefAug embeds \"reflection\" into each training instance. This reflection takes the form of alternative reasoning (exploring different problem-solving approaches) and follow-up reasoning (generalizing or extending the problem to new contexts). The goal is to foster a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and methodologies, moving beyond mere pattern recognition. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly improves performance in both standard single-round question-answering tasks and more complex scenarios requiring reflective thinking, such as error correction and multi-turn problem-solving. Importantly, RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, leading to further performance gains when combined. The method also shows promise in code generation tasks, suggesting its broader applicability in developing more robust reasoning capabilities in LMs.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) is a new training technique that integrates problem reflection (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into existing training data.\n*   RefAug aims to deepen LMs' understanding of mathematical concepts and methodologies, going beyond basic forward reasoning.\n*   The technique significantly improves performance on both standard math reasoning and complex reflective reasoning tasks, such as error correction and multi-turn problem-solving.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation methods, leading to synergistic performance improvements when combined.\n*   The approach has shown effectiveness in code generation tasks, indicating its potential for broader applications.",
