SUMMARY:**\n\nThis paper empirically argues for the elimination of the scaling coefficient hyperparameter (alpha) in model merging by demonstrating that a fixed value of alpha=1.0 consistently yields optimal or near-optimal results for their proposed TSV-Merge approach. Through extensive experiments on various Vision Transformer models and multiple task datasets, the authors show that tuning alpha provides negligible performance gains that do not justify the computational cost and the need for validation data. This finding simplifies the practical application of their method, making it more efficient and accessible. The paper leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices, termed Task Singular Vectors (TSVs), to compress task representations and reduce task interference. The empirical evidence presented strongly supports the claim that a fixed alpha value is sufficient, effectively removing it as a tunable hyperparameter for their model merging strategy.\n\n**2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:**\n\n*   The paper empirically demonstrates that the scaling coefficient (alpha) hyperparameter is not necessary for optimal performance in their TSV-Merge model merging approach.\n*   A fixed alpha value of 1.0 consistently achieves the best or near-best results across various models and task combinations.\n*   Tuning alpha offers marginal performance improvements that do not outweigh the computational cost and the requirement for validation data.\n*   This finding simplifies the TSV-Merge method, making it more practical by eliminating the need for hyperparameter tuning and validation sets.\n*   The empirical evidence supports the complete removal of the alpha hyperparameter from the model merging process.",

The research analyzes the Singular Task Interference (STI) and its correlation with model merging accuracy, showing that minimizing STI leads to significant performance gains.

The authors empirically demonstrate that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs can represent a task with high fidelity, enabling significant compression (TSV-Compress, or TSV-C) with minimal accuracy loss. Crucially, the TSVs provide a geometric framework to measure and reduce task interference. By decorrelating TSVs from different tasks using whitening transformations (equivalent to solving an orthogonal Procrustes problem), the TSV-Merge (TSV-M) approach effectively minimizes interference. Experiments show TSV-M significantly outperforms existing methods like Task Arithmetic and Consensus TA, achieving state-of-the-art results. The ablation study confirms that both low-rank approximation and interference reduction contribute to performance gains, with their combination being most effective. The paper also notes that interference is higher in earlier layers and that their method does not require tuning a scaling coefficient.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Task matrices are inherently low-rank, allowing for compression down to 10% of original size while retaining 99% accuracy (TSV-C).\n*   Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) enable a geometric measure of task interference, which is reduced by decorrelating TSVs via whitening.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines low-rank compression with interference reduction, significantly outperforming existing model merging techniques.\n*   Both low-rank approximation and interference reduction are crucial for TSV-M's superior performance, with their combined effect being optimal.\n*   Task interference is observed to be higher in earlier layers of the network and decreases in deeper layers.",

The core empirical argument for eliminating the scaling coefficient hyperparameter stems from the finding that the proposed TSV-Merge (TSV-M) method achieves optimal performance with a default scaling coefficient of α=1.0, rendering hyperparameter tuning unnecessary. This observation, supported by experimental results (Figure 7), simplifies the practical application of TSV-M by removing the need for validation data and labels. The paper demonstrates that TSV-M effectively reduces task interference through orthogonalization of TSVs and leverages their low-rank nature for compression (TSV-C). The ablation studies (Table 4, 5, 6) confirm that while both components are beneficial, the combined approach yields the best results. The empirical evidence suggests that TSV-M's performance is robust to the scaling coefficient, allowing for its elimination without significant accuracy degradation.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n* The proposed TSV-Merge (TSV-M) method consistently achieves its best performance with a scaling coefficient α=1.0, negating the need for hyperparameter tuning.\n* This empirical observation simplifies the practical application of TSV-M by removing the requirement for validation datasets and labels.\n* Ablation studies confirm that TSV-M's effectiveness is driven by both low-rank approximation and interference reduction, with the combined approach yielding optimal results.\n* The paper empirically demonstrates that the interference reduction component, when applied to low-rank approximations, is more effective than when applied to full-rank matrices due to reduced approximation errors during orthogonalization.\n* TSV-M significantly outperforms existing model merging methods by an average of 15% accuracy points, establishing a new state of the art.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Task Singular Vectors (TSV) as a novel approach to model merging, focusing on layer-level analysis of task matrices through Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The core empirical argument for eliminating the scaling coefficient hyperparameter stems from the finding that the proposed TSV-Merge (TSV-M) method consistently achieves optimal results with a scaling factor (α) of 1.0, rendering further tuning unnecessary. This observation simplifies the practical application of the method by removing the need for validation sets and labels. The research demonstrates that TSV-M, which combines low-rank approximation with interference reduction, significantly outperforms existing model merging techniques. The study empirically validates that the interference reduction component, when applied to the low-rank approximations derived from SVD, is more effective than when applied to full-rank matrices, due to reduced approximation errors during orthogonalization. This approach not only compresses task vectors efficiently while retaining high accuracy but also addresses task interference directly, leading to state-of-the-art performance in model merging without requiring hyperparameter tuning for the scaling coefficient.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The proposed TSV-Merge (TSV-M) method empirically demonstrates optimal performance with a fixed scaling coefficient (α) of 1.0, eliminating the need for tuning this hyperparameter.\n*   This independence from the scaling coefficient simplifies the model merging process by removing the requirement for validation datasets and labels.\n*   TSV-M's effectiveness is attributed to the synergistic combination of low-rank approximation (via SVD) and interference reduction, outperforming methods that rely solely on one or the other.\n*   The paper's analysis shows that interference reduction is more beneficial when applied to low-rank approximations, as it incurs lower approximation errors during orthogonalization.\n*   The method achieves state-of-the-art results in model merging, effectively reducing task interference and enabling efficient compression without compromising accuracy.",

The core empirical argument for eliminating the scaling coefficient hyperparameter stems from the observation that TSV-Merge (TSV-M), the proposed method, achieves optimal performance with a fixed scaling coefficient of α=1.0. This finding, demonstrated empirically (Section 6.3), significantly simplifies the model merging process by removing the need for hyperparameter tuning and validation data. The paper establishes that TSV-M's effectiveness, which combines low-rank approximation and interference reduction, is not sensitive to variations in this scaling factor. This independence from α underscores the robustness of the TSV-based approach and directly supports its practical applicability by eliminating a tuning step often required in other model merging techniques. The empirical evidence suggests that the inherent properties of TSVs and the interference reduction mechanism are sufficient for high performance without needing to adjust a global scaling coefficient.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The proposed TSV-Merge method achieves optimal performance with a fixed scaling coefficient of α=1.0, eliminating the need for hyperparameter tuning.\n*   This empirical finding simplifies the model merging process by removing the dependency on validation data and tuning for the scaling coefficient.\n*   The robustness of TSV-Merge to the scaling coefficient highlights the effectiveness of its core components (low-rank approximation and interference reduction).\n*   The independence from tuning the scaling coefficient enhances the practicality and efficiency of the TSV-based model merging approach.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices to address model merging challenges, particularly task interference. The empirical analysis reveals that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning only a small subset of TSVs is needed to represent a layer's function with high fidelity. This low-rank property underpins TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a method that compresses task vectors to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% accuracy, offering a fixed storage requirement. Furthermore, the paper proposes TSV-Merge (TSV-M), which leverages TSVs for interference reduction by decorrelating them through orthogonalization. This approach significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results. Crucially, the empirical findings demonstrate that TSV-M consistently achieves optimal performance with a scaling coefficient (α) of 1.0, eliminating the need for hyperparameter tuning and validation data, thus simplifying practical application.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Task matrices are empirically shown to be low-rank, with a small fraction of Singular Vectors (TSVs) capturing most of the task's information.\n*   This low-rank property enables significant compression (TSV-C) while maintaining high accuracy and a consistent storage footprint.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) reduces task interference by decorrelating TSVs, leading to substantial performance gains over existing methods.\n*   The proposed TSV-Merge method achieves optimal results with a fixed scaling coefficient (α = 1.0), removing the need for hyperparameter tuning and validation.",

The authors empirically demonstrate that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs can represent a task's function with high fidelity. This observation forms the basis for TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a compression method that reduces task vector size by 10% while retaining 99% of accuracy. Furthermore, the paper proposes TSV-Merge (TSV-M), which leverages TSVs to reduce task interference by decorrelating them through a whitening transformation. This approach significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results. Crucially, the empirical analysis shows that TSV-M consistently performs best with a scaling coefficient (α) of 1.0, eliminating the need for hyperparameter tuning and validation data, thereby enhancing practicality. The study also reveals that task interference is higher in earlier layers and decreases in deeper, more specialized layers.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Task matrices are empirically shown to be low-rank, enabling significant compression via TSV-Compress (TSV-C) while maintaining high accuracy.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) leverages Singular Task Vectors (TSVs) to reduce inter-task interference by decorrelating them, leading to state-of-the-art model merging performance.\n*   The proposed TSV-M method demonstrates empirical independence from the scaling coefficient (α), performing optimally with α=1.0 and thus removing the need for hyperparameter tuning.\n*   Task interference is found to be higher in early layers of neural networks and diminishes in deeper, more specialized layers.",

The authors empirically demonstrate that these layer-wise task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs can represent a task's contribution with high fidelity. This low-rank property is leveraged to develop TSV-Compress (TSV-C), which compresses task vectors to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% of accuracy. Furthermore, the interaction of TSVs across different tasks provides a fine-grained measure of task interference. This understanding leads to TSV-Merge (TSV-M), a novel method that combines compression with interference reduction by decorrelating TSVs using a whitening transformation. TSV-M significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results. Crucially, the paper provides empirical evidence that TSV-M achieves optimal performance with a scaling coefficient (α) of 1.0, eliminating the need for hyperparameter tuning and validation data, thus simplifying its practical application.\n\n2.
