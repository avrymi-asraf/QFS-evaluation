SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the implicit regularization induced by teacher-student learning dynamics in self-distillation, specifically focusing on the role of input data distribution. By using randomly initialized \"teachers\" instead of trained ones, the study isolates the effect of the learning process itself, devoid of \"dark knowledge\" from a well-trained teacher or data augmentation. The research reveals that even with random teachers and no data augmentation, students learn meaningful representations that significantly outperform their teachers in terms of probing accuracy. These learned representations are demonstrably data-dependent, as evidenced by their strong performance degradation when trained on random noise inputs and their transferability across different tasks when trained on natural images. Conversely, training on random inputs leads to poor performance on clean data, confirming that the learning is tied to the structure of the input distribution. The proximity of student initialization to the teacher also plays a crucial role, amplifying this feature learning.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Learned representations are data-dependent, showing significant performance degradation when trained on random noise inputs compared to natural images.\n*   The quality of learned representations improves with the size of the training dataset, indicating a reliance on the input data distribution.\n*   Features learned through random teacher distillation are transferable to different tasks, suggesting they capture generalizable properties of natural images.\n*   Training on random inputs, while preserving the same network architecture, leads to poor performance on clean data, reinforcing the importance of the input distribution's structure.",
