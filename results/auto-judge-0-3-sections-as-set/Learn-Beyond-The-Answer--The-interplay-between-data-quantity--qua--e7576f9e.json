SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces \"reflective augmentation\" (RefAug), a novel technique to enhance language models' (LMs) mathematical reasoning capabilities beyond traditional data expansion. The core idea is to embed problem reflection within each training instance, encouraging LMs to consider alternative perspectives and engage with abstractions or analogies. This approach aims to cultivate a deeper understanding of mathematical problems, moving beyond mere answer generation. Experiments show that RefAug significantly improves performance on standard single-round math reasoning tasks, achieving an average accuracy gain of +7.2. Crucially, RefAug also markedly enhances performance in more complex reflective reasoning scenarios (like follow-up questions and error correction), areas where existing data augmentation methods fall short. The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing techniques, leading to even greater performance improvements when combined. The method has also demonstrated effectiveness in code generation, suggesting reflection is a fundamental aspect of logical problem-solving.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) trains LMs by embedding \"reflection\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into each training instance, fostering deeper understanding.\n*   RefAug yields significant accuracy gains (+7.2 average) on standard math reasoning tasks and notably improves performance on complex reflective reasoning tasks, where other methods struggle.\n*   The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to synergistic performance improvements.\n*   RefAug enhances LMs' problem-solving by reducing reasoning errors, not just calculation errors.\n*   The technique is also effective in code generation, highlighting the general applicability of reflection in logical tasks.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel training technique for language models (LMs) that enhances their mathematical reasoning capabilities by embedding problem reflection into training instances. Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the dataset size, RefAug focuses on enriching each instance with alternative and follow-up reasoning. This approach aims to cultivate a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and methodologies, leading to improved performance in both standard single-round question-answering and more complex reflective reasoning scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts accuracy on various math reasoning tasks and is complementary to existing augmentation techniques, yielding even greater gains when combined. The method is also extended to code generation, showing consistent improvements. Analysis confirms the quality and stability of RefAug data annotation, with ablation studies highlighting the importance of both alternative and follow-up reasoning components. While budget constraints limit large-scale testing, the results suggest that higher quality data, potentially from advanced annotators, is crucial for developing sophisticated reflective reasoning skills.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective Augmentation (RefAug) enhances LM math reasoning by adding \"alternative\" and \"follow-up\" reasoning to training data, fostering deeper understanding beyond mere problem-solving.\n*   RefAug significantly improves performance in both standard math QA and complex reflective reasoning tasks, and its benefits are complementary to existing data augmentation methods.\n*   The technique is effective in code generation, demonstrating its broad applicability for improving logical reasoning in LMs.\n*   Ablation studies confirm that both alternative and follow-up reasoning components are crucial for RefAug's success, with combined usage yielding the best results.\n*   High-quality data annotation is key for RefAug, especially for developing advanced reflective reasoning, though budget constraints remain a limitation for large-scale validation.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel technique to enhance language model (LM) performance on mathematical tasks by embedding problem reflection into training data. Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands dataset size, RefAug focuses on enriching each instance with \"alternative reasoning\" (different solution paths) and \"follow-up reasoning\" (generalization or application to new contexts). Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance on standard single-round math QA tasks, achieving a +7.2 accuracy gain. Crucially, it excels in complex reflective reasoning scenarios (e.g., follow-up questions, error correction) where other augmentation methods falter, showing gains of over +10%. RefAug also proves complementary to existing techniques, leading to further improvements when combined. Analysis indicates that the reduction in errors is primarily due to fewer reasoning mistakes, suggesting a deeper understanding. While GPT-4-turbo is effective for annotation, the quality of the reflective sections is key for advanced reasoning. The method is also shown to be effective in code generation tasks, demonstrating its versatility.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LM math reasoning by adding \"alternative\" and \"follow-up\" reasoning to training instances, improving deep understanding beyond mere data quantity.\n*   RefAug achieves significant accuracy gains (+7.2) on standard math tasks and substantially outperforms other methods on complex reflective reasoning tasks (+10.6 average gain).\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation methods, yielding synergistic performance improvements.\n*   The primary benefit of RefAug stems from reducing reasoning errors, indicating a deeper grasp of mathematical concepts.\n*   RefAug demonstrates effectiveness in code generation, highlighting its general applicability to tasks requiring logical step-by-step processes.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel technique to enhance language models' mathematical reasoning by embedding problem reflection into training data. Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the dataset size, RefAug focuses on enriching the sequence dimension of existing data with \"alternative reasoning\" (different approaches to solve the same problem) and \"follow-up reasoning\" (generalizing or extending the problem). Experiments show RefAug significantly boosts performance on standard single-round math QA tasks (+7.2 accuracy gain) and critically enhances performance on more complex reflective reasoning scenarios (e.g., follow-up questions, error correction), where other data expansion methods fall short. RefAug is also complementary to existing augmentation techniques, leading to further gains. The method is effective in code generation and its benefits scale with the percentage of data augmented. Ablation studies confirm both components of reflection contribute positively, with follow-up reasoning showing particular strength in promoting deeper understanding.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by incorporating alternative and follow-up reasoning into training data, improving performance on both standard and complex reflective tasks.\n*   RefAug provides significant accuracy gains (+7.2) on standard math reasoning and substantial improvements on reflective tasks, outperforming traditional data expansion methods in these complex scenarios.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation techniques (Q-Aug, A-Aug, MetaMath), yielding synergistic performance benefits.\n*   The effectiveness of RefAug extends to code generation tasks, demonstrating its general applicability for improving logical reasoning in LMs.\n*   Both alternative and follow-up reasoning components contribute to improved performance, with follow-up reasoning particularly effective in fostering deeper conceptual understanding and flexible application of methodologies.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces \"reflective augmentation\" (RefAug), a novel method to enhance language models' (LMs) mathematical reasoning by embedding problem reflection into training instances. Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the dataset size, RefAug focuses on enriching the sequence dimension by adding \"alternative\" and \"follow-up\" reasoning components to existing solutions. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance on standard single-round math problems, achieving a notable accuracy gain. Crucially, it excels in more complex reflective reasoning scenarios (like follow-up questions and error correction) where traditional methods falter. RefAug is also complementary to existing augmentation techniques, leading to further substantial improvements when combined. Ablation studies confirm the value of both alternative and follow-up reasoning components. The quality of data annotation, while better with GPT-4, shows LLaMA-3 can still provide benefits, though with a slight dip in reflective reasoning performance. The method proves scalable and generalizes to code generation tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) improves LMs' mathematical reasoning by adding \"alternative\" and \"follow-up\" reasoning to training data, enhancing understanding beyond simple answer generation.\n*   RefAug yields significant accuracy gains on standard math tasks and dramatically improves performance on complex reflective reasoning scenarios, where traditional data expansion methods are less effective.\n*   RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, showing synergistic improvements when combined.\n*   Both alternative and follow-up reasoning components contribute to RefAug's effectiveness, with combining them yielding the best results.\n*   While GPT-4-annotated data leads to superior reflective reasoning performance, open-source models like LLaMA-3 can also provide beneficial augmentation data.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel technique for fine-tuning language models (LMs) on mathematical tasks. RefAug enhances training data by embedding \"reflection\" into each instance, encouraging deeper understanding beyond just the correct answer. This reflection takes two forms: alternative reasoning (exploring different solution paths) and follow-up reasoning (generalizing or extending the problem). The research demonstrates that RefAug significantly boosts LM performance on both standard single-round math reasoning tasks (achieving a +7.2 accuracy gain) and more complex reflective reasoning scenarios (like follow-up questions and error correction), where traditional data augmentation methods often fall short. Crucially, RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing augmentation techniques, leading to even greater performance improvements when combined. The study also found that RefAug is effective for code generation and that the quality of the reflective sections, particularly when annotated by high-quality models like GPT-4, is key to its success. The paper addresses diminishing returns from simple data expansion by highlighting how RefAug offers a different dimension of learning.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LM performance on standard math reasoning by +7.2 accuracy and significantly improves capabilities in complex reflective reasoning tasks.\n*   RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing data augmentation methods, leading to synergistic performance gains.\n*   While data quantity expansion shows diminishing returns, RefAug deepens understanding by incorporating reflective thought processes.\n*   The quality of reflective annotations, particularly from advanced models like GPT-4, is crucial for achieving strong performance in reflective reasoning.\n*   RefAug is effective in code generation tasks, demonstrating its broad applicability beyond pure mathematical reasoning.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel technique to enhance language models (LMs) for mathematical reasoning by embedding problem reflection into training instances. Unlike traditional data augmentation that increases data quantity, RefAug focuses on enriching the quality of existing data by adding \"alternative\" and \"follow-up\" reasoning sections. Experiments show RefAug significantly improves performance on standard single-round math problems, achieving a +7.2 accuracy gain. Crucially, it also substantially boosts capabilities in complex reflective reasoning scenarios (e.g., follow-up questions, error correction), where data expansion methods often falter. RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing techniques, leading to further performance gains when combined. The method also shows promise in code generation. Ablation studies confirm the value of both alternative and follow-up reasoning components, with greater performance achieved when both are present. The effectiveness of RefAug scales with the proportion of augmented data, and its implementation does not negatively impact inference efficiency.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LM performance on standard math reasoning tasks by +7.2 accuracy, and significantly improves performance on complex reflective reasoning tasks where data expansion methods are less effective.\n*   RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing data augmentation techniques like question and answer augmentation, leading to synergistic performance gains.\n*   Both \"alternative reasoning\" and \"follow-up reasoning\" components of RefAug contribute to performance improvements, with their combined use yielding the best results.\n*   RefAug's effectiveness scales with the proportion of augmented data, and it does not negatively impact inference efficiency due to early stopping during generation.\n*   The quality of the annotator model (GPT-4 vs. LLaMA-3) impacts the degree of improvement, particularly for reflective reasoning tasks, suggesting higher quality data leads to better outcomes.",

Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the dataset size, RefAug enriches each training instance by appending a \"reflective section.\" This section includes alternative reasoning approaches and follow-up reasoning (abstraction or analogy), encouraging LMs to develop a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and problem-solving methodologies. Experiments show that RefAug significantly improves performance on both standard single-round math reasoning tasks (a +7.2 accuracy gain) and, more notably, on complex reflective reasoning scenarios where traditional methods fall short. The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to further substantial gains when combined. Analysis indicates that the improvement stems from a reduction in reasoning errors rather than calculation errors. The method is also effective for code generation and demonstrates scalability, with performance increasing as a larger proportion of data is augmented.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by embedding \"reflection\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data, leading to deeper understanding.\n*   RefAug significantly boosts performance on complex reflective reasoning tasks, outperforming traditional data expansion methods.\n*   RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing augmentation techniques, yielding synergistic improvements when combined.\n*   The primary impact of RefAug is observed in reducing reasoning errors, not calculation errors, suggesting an improved grasp of underlying mathematical logic.\n*   RefAug demonstrates effectiveness across diverse tasks, including code generation, and scales well with increasing data augmentation percentages.",

Unlike traditional data augmentation that focuses on increasing the quantity of training data, RefAug enriches each training instance with a \"reflection\" section. This section encourages the LM to engage in alternative reasoning and follow-up reasoning, fostering a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and problem-solving methodologies. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance on both standard single-round math problems (a +7.2 accuracy gain) and more complex reflective reasoning tasks (e.g., +22.3 accuracy on error correction). Crucially, RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to even greater performance improvements when combined. The study also shows that RefAug is effective in code generation and that its impact is consistent across different model architectures, suggesting that embracing reflective learning is essential for enhancing LM capabilities in complex reasoning.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LMs by embedding \"reflection\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data, promoting deeper understanding beyond just solving problems.\n*   RefAug significantly improves performance on both standard math reasoning (+7.2 accuracy) and complex reflective reasoning tasks, outperforming traditional data expansion methods in the latter.\n*   The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, leading to synergistic performance gains.\n*   RefAug reduces reasoning errors more effectively than calculation errors, indicating a deeper impact on logical problem-solving.\n*   The technique is generalizable, showing improvements in code generation and across different LM architectures.",

RefAug augments training instances by incorporating \"reflection\" – alternative perspectives and follow-up reasoning – into the problem-solving process. The core idea is that simply increasing data quantity (through traditional augmentation like question or answer expansion) doesn't necessarily lead to deeper understanding. RefAug targets the sequence dimension of training data, aiming to foster reflective thinking. Experiments show that RefAug significantly improves performance on both standard single-round math reasoning tasks (+7.2 accuracy) and, more critically, on complex reflective reasoning scenarios (e.g., follow-up questions, error correction) where traditional methods fall short. The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to even greater gains. The study also confirms that RefAug is effective in code generation and that its benefits scale with the proportion of augmented data, while also reducing reasoning errors more than calculation errors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by embedding \"reflection\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data.\n*   RefAug provides substantial gains on complex reflective reasoning tasks, outperforming traditional data expansion methods in these scenarios.\n*   RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, leading to synergistic performance improvements.\n*   The method effectively reduces reasoning errors, indicating a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts rather than just pattern memorization.\n*   RefAug demonstrates scalability and effectiveness across different LMs and tasks, including code generation.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel technique for fine-tuning language models (LMs) on mathematical tasks, addressing the limitations of traditional data expansion methods. While existing methods increase data quantity by augmenting questions or answers, they often fail to foster deeper understanding, particularly in complex, reflective reasoning scenarios. RefAug addresses this by embedding \"reflection\" into each training instance, including alternative reasoning (different approaches to the same problem) and follow-up reasoning (generalizing or extending the problem). Experiments show RefAug significantly boosts performance on both standard single-round math QA (+7.2 accuracy) and, crucially, on reflective reasoning tasks (e.g., +22.3 accuracy on error correction), where traditional methods falter. RefAug's benefits are complementary, leading to further gains when combined with existing techniques, and it also shows promise in code generation. The study also highlights that while data quantity from expansion methods shows diminishing returns, RefAug's focus on quality of understanding offers a more robust improvement, even with smaller datasets.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LM performance on mathematical tasks by incorporating \"reflection\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data, leading to deeper understanding beyond just more examples.\n*   RefAug provides substantial gains on complex reflective reasoning tasks where traditional data expansion methods are less effective or even detrimental.\n*   The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, leading to synergistic performance improvements.\n*   RefAug improves accuracy by reducing reasoning errors, suggesting a deeper grasp of mathematical concepts rather than just surface-level pattern matching.\n*   While data quantity from traditional methods shows diminishing returns, RefAug's quality-focused approach offers consistent gains and is effective even when applied to a portion of the dataset.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel technique to enhance language models (LMs) for mathematical reasoning by incorporating problem reflection into training data. Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the dataset size, RefAug augments the sequence dimension by adding \"alternative\" and \"follow-up\" reasoning sections to existing training instances. This approach cultivates a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and methodologies, moving beyond rote memorization. Experiments show RefAug significantly boosts performance on standard single-round math problems, achieving a +7.2 accuracy gain. Crucially, it excels in more complex reflective reasoning scenarios (like follow-up questions and error correction), where traditional augmentation methods fall short. RefAug also complements existing data expansion techniques, leading to further performance improvements. Ablation studies confirm the value of both alternative and follow-up reasoning components. The method is also effective in code generation, demonstrating its broad applicability.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by embedding problem reflection (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data, improving understanding beyond just solving problems.\n*   RefAug significantly boosts performance on standard math tasks (+7.2 accuracy) and critically enhances capabilities in complex reflective reasoning scenarios where other methods struggle.\n*   The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing data augmentation methods, leading to synergistic performance gains and mitigating diminishing returns from simple data expansion.\n*   Ablation studies show that both alternative and follow-up reasoning components contribute to performance improvements, with their combination yielding the best results.\n*   RefAug is also effective in code generation tasks, indicating its generalizability in improving LM reasoning abilities across different domains.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel technique to enhance language models (LMs) for mathematical reasoning by embedding problem reflection into training data. Unlike traditional data augmentation that focuses on increasing data quantity, RefAug enriches each training instance with \"alternative\" and \"follow-up\" reasoning components. This approach aims to cultivate a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and problem-solving methodologies. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance on standard single-round math problems, achieving a +7.2 accuracy gain. Crucially, it excels in complex reflective reasoning scenarios (like error correction and multi-turn problem-solving) where traditional methods falter, showing substantial improvements (+22.3 in error correction). RefAug also proves complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to synergistic gains, and is effective in code generation tasks. The study highlights that while data quantity is important, the quality and nature of the data, as introduced by RefAug, are vital for developing robust mathematical reasoning capabilities, particularly for more complex, reflective tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by incorporating \"alternative\" and \"follow-up\" reasoning into training data, fostering deeper understanding beyond just solving problems.\n*   RefAug significantly improves performance on complex reflective reasoning tasks (e.g., error correction, multi-turn QA), outperforming traditional data expansion methods in these areas.\n*   The method is complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, yielding synergistic performance gains.\n*   RefAug's effectiveness is demonstrated across various models and tasks, including code generation, suggesting its broad applicability.\n*   The study implies that for advanced mathematical reasoning, especially reflective tasks, the *quality* and *nature* of augmented data (like RefAug) are more impactful than simply increasing data *quantity*.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces \"reflective augmentation\" (RefAug) as a novel method to enhance language models' mathematical reasoning capabilities beyond standard supervised fine-tuning. The core idea is to enrich training data not by adding more problems, but by embedding \"reflection\" into existing problem instances. This reflection takes two forms: alternative reasoning (exploring different solution paths) and follow-up reasoning (generalizing or extending the problem). Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly improves performance on standard single-round math problems, achieving a +7.2 accuracy gain. Crucially, it excels in more complex reflective reasoning scenarios (like error correction or multi-turn problem-solving) where traditional data expansion methods fall short, showing gains of up to +22.3. RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, leading to further substantial improvements when combined. An ablation study confirms the benefit of both reflection components, and an error analysis indicates that RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors, suggesting a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts. The method is also shown to be effective in code generation tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) enhances language models' mathematical reasoning by embedding \"alternative\" and \"follow-up\" reasoning into training data, rather than just increasing data quantity.\n*   RefAug significantly improves performance on both standard math problems (+7.2 accuracy) and, more notably, on complex reflective reasoning tasks (up to +22.3 accuracy gains).\n*   RefAug is complementary to traditional data augmentation methods (like question or answer augmentation), leading to synergistic performance improvements.\n*   The method primarily reduces reasoning errors, indicating a deeper grasp of mathematical principles, and is also effective in code generation tasks.\n*   While data quantity is important, RefAug demonstrates that the *quality* of augmentation, by incorporating reflective thinking, is key to improving complex reasoning skills.",

Unlike traditional data augmentation, which expands the training set with more problems, RefAug enriches each training instance by appending a \"reflection\" section. This section includes alternative reasoning approaches and follow-up scenarios (abstraction or analogy), encouraging deeper problem comprehension. Experiments show that RefAug significantly boosts performance on standard single-round math problems (+7.2 accuracy) and, crucially, excels in complex reflective reasoning tasks (e.g., follow-up questions, error correction), where traditional methods falter. RefAug also demonstrates complementary benefits when combined with existing data expansion techniques, leading to even greater gains and mitigating diminishing returns. The study also explores RefAug's effectiveness in code generation and analyzes the impact of different reflection components and data quantities, concluding that integrating reflection is vital for robust mathematical reasoning.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LM performance in mathematical reasoning by embedding problem reflection (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data, going beyond simple data quantity increases.\n*   RefAug significantly improves performance on complex reflective reasoning tasks (e.g., follow-up questions, error correction), where traditional data augmentation methods show limited or negative gains.\n*   The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, leading to synergistic improvements and mitigating diminishing returns from repeated data expansion.\n*   Ablation studies show that both alternative and follow-up reasoning components contribute to performance gains, with their combination yielding the best results.\n*   RefAug's effectiveness extends beyond math to code generation, demonstrating its general applicability for improving LM reasoning capabilities.",
