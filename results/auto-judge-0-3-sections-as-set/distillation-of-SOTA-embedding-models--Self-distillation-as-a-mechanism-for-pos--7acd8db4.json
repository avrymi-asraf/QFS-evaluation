      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a novel embedding model that utilizes a multi-stage distillation framework to learn from multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models. The core of this process is a distillation mechanism designed to transfer knowledge from larger, more powerful models to a smaller student model, named Jasper. This distillation is achieved through three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. These losses progressively guide the student model to align its representations with the teachers, moving from specific pairwise similarities to broader relative ranking preferences. To further enhance efficiency and applicability, the framework incorporates Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for effective vector dimensionality reduction. The paper also touches upon a self-distillation approach for post-hoc modality alignment, where earlier stage student vectors act as teachers for reduced-dimension vectors, and a preliminary stage 4 that aligns vision and text embeddings. Jasper, built upon the Stella embedding model, demonstrates competitive performance with much larger models on the MTEB benchmark, achieving a strong position despite its significantly smaller parameter count.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a multi-stage distillation framework to learn from multiple SOTA embedding models, effectively transferring knowledge to a smaller student model.\n*   The distillation process is guided by three loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss, which capture different aspects of representation alignment.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is used to reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model, making it more practical for real-world applications.\n*   A self-distillation mechanism is proposed for post-hoc modality alignment, using internal student representations as teachers for dimensionality reduction.\n*   Jasper achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models with only 2B parameters, showcasing the efficacy of the distillation approach.",

The core of their approach is to distill knowledge from multiple, larger state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding models (teachers) into a smaller student model. This distillation process utilizes three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (matching semantic discrepancies between text pairs), and relative similarity distillation loss (preserving relative ranking preferences). To further enhance efficiency, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed to reduce the student model's vector dimensionality. Jasper, built on Stella, achieved a remarkable No. 3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating performance comparable to much larger 7B parameter models despite being only 2B parameters. The framework also includes a stage for preliminary multimodal alignment using a self-distillation mechanism, where text embeddings guide visual encoder training. This method allows for the creation of powerful, compact embedding models without relying on supervised data.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a multi-stage distillation process to transfer knowledge from multiple SOTA teacher embedding models to a smaller student model.\n*   Three distinct loss functions (cosine loss, similarity loss, relative similarity distillation loss) are used to guide the distillation, moving from specific to broader semantic alignment.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized for effective dimension reduction of the student model's embeddings.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, significantly outperforming other models in its size class.\n*   A self-distillation mechanism is used in a final stage for preliminary multimodal alignment between text and image embeddings.",

After concatenating teacher embeddings to 12,288 dimensions, additional FC layers are introduced to create lower-dimensional outputs (e.g., 512-dim). During this stage, the 12,288-dimensional vectors from FC1 are trained using all three losses (cosine, similarity, and relative similarity), while the lower-dimensional outputs from subsequent FC layers (FC2, FC3, FC4) are trained using only similarity and relative similarity losses. Notably, a self-distillation approach is proposed where the 12,288-dimensional vectors serve as teacher signals for these shorter vectors, allowing for dimensionality reduction using only unsupervised data and the model itself.\n\nStage 4 aims to unlock multimodal potential by training the vision encoder using image-caption pairs from BAAI/Infinity-MM. This stage employs a self-distillation mechanism where the caption's vector representation acts as the teacher, and the image's vector representation acts as the student. During this process, only the vision encoder is trained, while all other components, including the previously trained FC layers, are frozen. The reason for this being a \"preliminary alignment\" is attributed to time and resource constraints, with future work planned to further refine the multimodal alignment, potentially through contrastive learning on VQA datasets.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Stage 3 uses MRL with additional FC layers for dimension reduction, proposing self-distillation where the model's intermediate 12,288-dim vectors act as teachers for lower-dimensional outputs.\n*   Stage 4 trains the vision encoder using image-caption data from BAAI/Infinity-MM for multimodal alignment.\n*   In Stage 4, only the vision encoder is trained; all other components remain frozen.\n*   The alignment in Stage 4 is described as preliminary due to resource limitations, with plans for future enhancement.\n*   Stage 4's self-distillation uses caption embeddings as teacher vectors and image embeddings as student vectors.",
