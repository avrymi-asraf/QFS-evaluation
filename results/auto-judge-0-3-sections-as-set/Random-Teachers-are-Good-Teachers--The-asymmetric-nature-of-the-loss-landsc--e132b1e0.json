Contrary to expectations, a student model trained to mimic a randomly initialized teacher demonstrates significant improvements in representational quality, as measured by linear probing accuracy. This learning occurs even without \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or data augmentations, suggesting that the optimization dynamics themselves are a powerful source of regularization. The study reveals that initializing the student closely to the random teacher amplifies this effect, leading to better performance. Furthermore, the learned representations are data-dependent and transferable across tasks. Intriguingly, these randomly distilled students exhibit characteristics similar to early-stage supervised training, such as containing sparse subnetworks (lottery tickets) and residing near the boundaries of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape. This suggests that label-independent optimization can indeed explore aspects of the supervised loss landscape, highlighting the importance of understanding these underlying dynamics.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students trained to mimic random teachers achieve significantly better representational quality than their teachers, demonstrating learning without \"dark knowledge.\"\n*   Initializing the student closely to the random teacher amplifies the beneficial implicit regularization effects.\n*   The learned representations are data-dependent and transferable, indicating meaningful feature extraction even from random initializations.\n*   Random teacher distillation leads to sparse subnetworks and positions the student near linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, mimicking early supervised training phases.\n*   This work suggests that the optimization dynamics themselves, independent of labels or data augmentations, contribute significantly to feature learning in teacher-student setups.",

Specifically, it explores the behavior when distilling from a randomly initialized teacher, effectively stripping away any \"dark knowledge\" derived from training on data. Surprisingly, even with a random teacher and without data augmentation, the student model exhibits significant improvements in representational quality, as measured by linear probing accuracy, often surpassing its teacher. The learned representations are found to be data-dependent and transferable. Furthermore, the study reveals that student checkpoints contain sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and reside on the edge of linear basins within the supervised loss landscape. This implies that label-independent optimization dynamics can effectively explore the loss landscape. A key observation is that initializing the student closely to the teacher amplifies this implicit regularization, suggesting a beneficial \"locality effect\" within the loss landscape. The paper visualizes these landscapes, highlighting an asymmetric valley structure around the random teacher that the student exploits for better generalization.\n\n2.

Counter-intuitively, students distilling from these random teachers exhibit significant improvements in representation quality, surpassing their teachers and even raw input features. The study highlights a crucial \"locality effect,\" where initializing the student closely to the teacher (controlled by parameter α) amplifies this regularization. While independent initialization (α=1) still yields gains, closer proximity (α near 0) is optimal. The student checkpoints also demonstrate characteristics of \"lottery tickets,\" containing sparse subnetworks and residing near the border of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, even without explicit label supervision. This suggests that label-independent optimization dynamics can navigate the loss landscape, mirroring early stages of supervised training. The work also connects to prior research on asymmetric valleys, proposing that initializing close to the teacher allows students to capitalize on the flatter side of these valleys, leading to better generalization. Visualizations reveal that while the random teacher might be at a loss minimum, the student converges to a different local minimum associated with high probing accuracy, particularly when initialized closely.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Initializing the student closely to the random teacher (low α) significantly amplifies representation learning and performance gains.\n*   Student checkpoints, even from random teachers, exhibit characteristics of \"lottery tickets\" (sparse subnetworks) and lie near linear basins in the supervised loss landscape.\n*   The paper connects the beneficial effect of local initialization to asymmetric valleys in the loss landscape, suggesting students benefit from the flatter side of these structures.\n*   The study shows that students initialized close to the random teacher converge to local minima that coincide with regions of high probing accuracy, distinct from the teacher's position.\n*   The non-local view of the loss landscape is defined by the random teacher's parameters, the student's fresh initialization, and the student's converged parameters when initialized far from the teacher (α=1).",

A key finding is the significant impact of \"local initialization,\" where students initialized closely to the random teacher (controlled by parameter α) exhibit amplified feature learning. Even with independent initialization (α=1), students outperform random teachers, demonstrating that implicit regularization alone can drive meaningful learning without \"dark knowledge.\" The study also connects this to the lottery ticket hypothesis, showing that student checkpoints, trained via random teacher distillation, contain sparse subnetworks and reside at the edge of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape. Visualizations of the loss and probing landscapes highlight an \"asymmetric valley\" structure near the teacher, where moving away from the teacher's (global loss minimum) in a specific direction leads to a steep loss increase but a region of high probing accuracy, suggesting better generalization. This phenomenon is linked to early-stage supervised training dynamics.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Initializing students closely to a random teacher (low α) amplifies feature learning and leads to better representation quality.\n*   Student checkpoints trained with random teachers exhibit lottery ticket-like properties (sparse subnetworks) and are found near the boundaries of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape.\n*   Loss landscape visualizations reveal an \"asymmetric valley\" around the random teacher; moving along the flatter side of this valley, away from the teacher's global loss minimum, leads to improved probing accuracy.\n*   The dynamics observed in random teacher distillation mimic early stages of supervised training, suggesting implicit regularization can navigate the supervised loss landscape without labels.",

A key finding is the significant improvement in student performance over random teachers, even without \"dark knowledge\" from trained teachers or data augmentations. The study highlights the crucial role of \"local initialization,\" where initializing the student closely to the teacher (controlled by parameter α) amplifies learning. Even with independent initialization (α=1), students outperform teachers, but closer initialization (α near 0) yields better and faster convergence, revealing a locality phenomenon in the loss landscape. The student checkpoints exhibit characteristics similar to early supervised training, including the presence of sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and positioning at the boundary of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape. Visualizations of the loss and probing landscapes reveal an \"asymmetric valley\" structure near the teacher, which, when capitalized upon by a closely initialized student, appears to contribute to better generalization, a phenomenon also observed in related work on asymmetric valleys. This suggests that label-independent optimization dynamics can indeed navigate the supervised loss landscape.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Initializing the student closely to a random teacher (low α) significantly amplifies learning and leads to better performance and faster convergence compared to independent initialization (α=1).\n*   Student checkpoints obtained through random teacher distillation exhibit characteristics of \"lottery tickets\" (sparse subnetworks) and reside on the edge of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, mimicking early supervised training.\n*   The loss landscape around a random teacher exhibits an \"asymmetric valley\" structure, where moving away from the teacher in a specific direction leads to a steep loss increase, while moving in another direction leads to a gradual increase and a local minimum with high probing accuracy.\n*   The study demonstrates that feature learning is data-dependent, as performance improves with larger datasets and deteriorates with random inputs, and features are transferable across tasks.",

The core finding is that students can learn meaningful representations and even outperform their randomly initialized teachers without any \"dark knowledge\" or data augmentation. A key observation relates to \"local initialization,\" where initializing the student closely to the teacher (controlled by parameter α) significantly amplifies this implicit regularization. This phenomenon is linked to the loss landscape, revealing an \"asymmetric valley\" structure around the teacher. When initialized close to the teacher, the student settles into a local minimum within this valley, which surprisingly correlates with high probing accuracy, suggesting better generalization. Furthermore, student checkpoints exhibit properties similar to \"lottery tickets\" (sparse subnetworks) and demonstrate linear mode connectivity, mirroring early supervised training dynamics, all without explicit label supervision. The research also confirms data-dependence and transferability of these learned features across different tasks.\n\n2.

The key finding is that students can learn meaningful representations even from randomly initialized teachers, outperforming them in probing accuracy without any \"dark knowledge\" or data augmentation. The study highlights that initializing the student closely to the teacher (low locality parameter α) amplifies this learning, revealing an asymmetric valley structure in the loss landscape around the random teacher. This asymmetric valley, where the loss increases steeply in one direction but gradually in another, is shown to be beneficial for generalization. Furthermore, the student checkpoints exhibit properties akin to lottery tickets, containing sparse subnetworks and residing on the border of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, suggesting that random teacher distillation mimics early supervised training dynamics without requiring labels. The learned features are also found to be data-dependent and transferable across different tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students trained with random teachers significantly outperform their teachers in probing accuracy, demonstrating learning without \"dark knowledge.\"\n*   Initializing the student closely to the teacher (low locality parameter α) amplifies representation learning and is linked to an asymmetric valley in the loss landscape.\n*   Student checkpoints exhibit lottery ticket properties (sparse subnetworks, near linear basins) and mimic early supervised training dynamics, even without labels.\n*   Learned representations are data-dependent and transferable across different tasks.\n*   The asymmetric valley structure around the random teacher offers a path to better generalization, explaining the benefit of local initialization.",

The study finds that students trained with random teachers significantly outperform their teachers in representational quality, measured by linear probing accuracy. Crucially, this learning occurs even without \"dark knowledge\" from trained teachers or data augmentations. The research highlights the significant impact of local initialization, where students initialized closely to the teacher (low α) achieve better performance. This locality is linked to an observed asymmetric valley in the loss landscape around the teacher's parameters, where moving away from the teacher in a specific direction leads to a steep loss increase but also high probing accuracy. Furthermore, the student checkpoints exhibit characteristics of \"lottery tickets,\" containing sparse subnetworks and residing near linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, mirroring early stages of supervised training without explicit label supervision. The learned features are shown to be data-dependent and transferable across different tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students trained with random teachers significantly improve representational quality over their teachers, demonstrating implicit regularization without dark knowledge or data augmentation.\n*   Initializing the student closely to the teacher (low locality parameter α) amplifies representation learning, linked to an asymmetric valley in the loss landscape where one side offers high probing accuracy.\n*   Student checkpoints from random teacher distillation contain sparse subnetworks and are located near linear basins, resembling early supervised training dynamics without label information.\n*   Learned features are data-dependent and transferable to different tasks, showing that meaningful learning occurs from random initializations.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper explores self-distillation using random teachers, revealing that students can learn meaningful representations even without \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or data augmentations. A key finding is the significant impact of \"local initialization,\" where initializing the student closely to the teacher (controlled by parameter α) amplifies representation learning. Specifically, as α approaches 0 (meaning closer initialization), performance generally improves, although independent initialization (α=1) still yields gains. The study visualizes the loss and probing landscapes, highlighting an \"asymmetric valley\" structure around the teacher. This asymmetry appears to benefit generalization when the student is initialized close to the teacher, a phenomenon linked to the early phases of supervised learning. The student checkpoints also exhibit properties akin to \"lottery tickets,\" containing sparse subnetworks and residing near the border of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, suggesting that random teacher distillation can mimic early supervised training dynamics without explicit labels. The learned features are also shown to be data-dependent and transferable across different tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Initializing the student closely to a random teacher (low α) amplifies representation learning, with performance generally improving as α approaches 0.\n*   The loss landscape around a random teacher exhibits an \"asymmetric valley\" structure, which is beneficial for generalization when the student is initialized nearby.\n*   Students trained with random teachers develop sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and occupy regions near linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, mimicking early supervised training dynamics.\n*   Learned representations are data-dependent and transferable across tasks, even when distilled from a randomly initialized teacher.",

The core finding is that even without \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or data augmentation, students can learn meaningful representations and outperform their random teachers. This is attributed to the inherent properties of the optimization process. A key discovery is the significant impact of \"local initialization,\" where initializing the student close to the teacher (small α) amplifies representation learning. This phenomenon is linked to the loss landscape's structure, particularly an \"asymmetric valley\" around the teacher's random initialization. This asymmetric valley allows students initialized nearby to find local minima with high probing accuracy, even though the teacher resides in a global minimum. Furthermore, the student checkpoints exhibit characteristics of \"lottery tickets\" and early-phase supervised training dynamics, demonstrating that label-independent optimization can effectively navigate the supervised loss landscape. The learned features are also shown to be data-dependent and transferable across tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students initialized close to random teachers show amplified representation learning due to an \"asymmetric valley\" in the loss landscape.\n*   This asymmetric valley structure allows students to find local minima with high probing accuracy, distinct from the teacher's global minimum.\n*   Student checkpoints exhibit properties of \"lottery tickets\" and mimic early supervised training dynamics, suggesting label-independent navigation of the loss landscape.\n*   Learned features are data-dependent and transferable across different tasks, even when distilled from random teachers.\n*   The degree of \"local initialization\" (parameter α) significantly impacts performance, with values close to zero yielding the best results.",

The study reveals that students can learn meaningful representations and even surpass their randomly initialized teachers without any \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or data augmentations. A key finding is the significant impact of \"local initialization,\" where students initialized closely to the teacher (small α) exhibit better performance. This locality is linked to an \"asymmetric valley\" in the loss landscape around the random teacher, which, when navigated by the student, leads to improved generalization. Even when students are initialized independently (α=1), they still outperform the teacher, though less effectively. These findings suggest that the early phase of supervised training dynamics, characterized by moving towards flatter regions of the loss landscape and developing sparse subnetworks (lottery tickets), can be mimicked by random teacher distillation, independent of explicit labels. The research highlights that the loss landscape, particularly its asymmetric structures near random initializations, plays a crucial role in this phenomenon.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Initializing students closely to a random teacher (small locality parameter α) amplifies representation learning, correlating with improved probing accuracy.\n*   The loss landscape around a random teacher exhibits an \"asymmetric valley,\" where moving away from the teacher towards a local minimum improves generalization, a phenomenon observed to be amplified by local initialization.\n*   Students distilled from random teachers develop sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and converge to regions near the border of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, mimicking early supervised training dynamics without label information.\n*   Even with independent initialization (α=1), students still outperform random teachers, indicating representation learning occurs even without proximity, though less efficiently.\n*   The research uses visualization planes to illustrate the loss and probing landscapes, showing that student minima are distinct from the teacher's initial state, particularly in the \"shared view\" that includes both local (α≈0) and non-local (α=1) solutions.",

The authors demonstrate that even without \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or data augmentations, a student model can learn meaningful representations and even outperform its random teacher. A key finding is the impact of \"local initialization,\" where initializing the student closely to the teacher (controlled by a locality parameter α) significantly amplifies representation learning. This phenomenon is explored through loss landscape visualizations, which reveal asymmetric valleys around the teacher. The student, when initialized closely, converges to a local minimum within this asymmetric valley, leading to better generalization, a behavior that mirrors the early stages of supervised training. The student checkpoints also exhibit properties like sparse subnetworks (lottery tickets) and linear mode connectivity, suggesting they capture some of the beneficial dynamics of early supervised learning without explicit label supervision. The research highlights that the regularizing nature of learning dynamics, rather than just explicit data or teacher knowledge, is crucial for effective distillation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Initializing the student closely to a random teacher (low α) significantly amplifies representation learning and performance improvements.\n*   Loss landscape visualizations reveal asymmetric valleys around the random teacher, and students initialized nearby converge to local minima within these valleys, correlating with high probing accuracy.\n*   Student checkpoints from random teacher distillation exhibit lottery ticket properties (sparse subnetworks) and linear mode connectivity, mimicking early supervised training dynamics without labels.\n*   The study emphasizes that the inherent regularization in optimization dynamics, rather than just dark knowledge or data augmentation, plays a significant role in teacher-student learning.\n*   Features learned through random teacher distillation are data-dependent and transferable across different tasks.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the implicit regularization effects in teacher-student learning dynamics, specifically by using randomly initialized teachers instead of trained ones. This setup isolates the impact of the learning process itself, devoid of \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or data augmentation. A key finding is that even with random teachers, students exhibit significant improvements in representation quality, as measured by linear probing accuracy, surpassing their teachers and even raw input representations. The study highlights that initializing the student closely to the teacher (low locality parameter α) amplifies this effect, though some benefit persists even with independent initialization. This locality is linked to an \"asymmetric valley\" phenomenon in the loss landscape, where the student settles in a local minimum with higher probing accuracy, distinct from the teacher's minimum. Furthermore, the learned representations are shown to be data-dependent and transferable across tasks. The research also connects these dynamics to the early phases of supervised training, observing that student checkpoints develop sparse subnetworks (lottery tickets) and reside at the border of linear basins, mirroring early supervised learning behaviors without requiring explicit labels.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students distilled from random teachers significantly outperform their teachers in representation quality, even without \"dark knowledge\" or data augmentation.\n*   Initializing the student closely to the random teacher (low locality parameter α) amplifies learning, with benefits persisting even when initialized independently.\n*   The learning process exhibits an \"asymmetric valley\" in the loss landscape, allowing students to find local minima with higher probing accuracy, separate from the random teacher's initial state.\n*   Student checkpoints, like those in supervised learning, develop sparse subnetworks (lottery tickets) and reside near linear basins, indicating early-phase learning dynamics.\n*   Learned features are data-dependent and transferable across different tasks, suggesting meaningful feature extraction occurs even from random teachers.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the implicit regularization effects in teacher-student learning dynamics, specifically by using randomly initialized teachers instead of trained ones. The core finding is that even without \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or explicit data augmentations, a student model can learn meaningful representations and even outperform its random teacher. This is achieved through the gradient dynamics of the learning process. A crucial aspect explored is the impact of \"local initialization,\" where initializing the student closely to the teacher (controlled by parameter α) significantly amplifies this regularization effect, leading to better performance. The research also delves into the loss landscape, visualizing how students initialized close to the teacher can find local minima with high probing accuracy, often situated within asymmetric valleys. These findings suggest that label-independent optimization dynamics can mimic early supervised training phases, enabling exploration of the loss landscape and the development of sparse subnetworks (lottery tickets) without direct supervision. The learned features are also shown to be data-dependent and transferable across tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students can learn meaningful representations and outperform even randomly initialized teachers through implicit regularization in the learning dynamics.\n*   Initializing the student closely to the teacher (low α) significantly amplifies representation learning and performance gains.\n*   The loss landscape around random teachers exhibits asymmetric valleys, where students initialized nearby can find local minima with high probing accuracy.\n*   Random teacher distillation allows for the discovery of sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and mimics early phase supervised learning dynamics without explicit labels.\n*   Learned features are data-dependent and demonstrate transferability across different tasks.",
