The authors propose using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on per-layer task matrices to extract \"Task Singular Vectors\" (TSVs). They demonstrate that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs can represent the task's contribution with high fidelity. This insight leads to two key contributions: TSV-Compress (TSV-C), which compresses task vectors to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% accuracy, and TSV-Merge (TSV-M). TSV-M further leverages TSVs to measure and reduce task interference by decorrelating singular vectors across tasks. Empirical results show TSV-M significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance by reducing task interference and enabling efficient compression, directly addressing the limitations of flattened parameter approaches.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Model merging methods that treat networks as flat vectors overlook crucial structural information and are prone to task interference.\n*   Analyzing per-layer task matrices using Singular Value Decomposition reveals a low-rank structure and yields Task Singular Vectors (TSVs).\n*   TSVs enable both efficient compression (TSV-Compress) and a novel interference reduction mechanism for model merging (TSV-Merge).\n*   TSV-Merge significantly outperforms existing methods by combining low-rank approximation with interference reduction, leading to improved accuracy.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper proposes a structure-aware approach to model merging, moving beyond flattened parameter vectors by analyzing singular value decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices. The authors introduce \"Task Singular Vectors\" (TSVs) which capture task-specific contributions at the layer level. They demonstrate that these layer task matrices are inherently low-rank, allowing for significant compression with minimal accuracy loss. Their proposed method, TSV-Compress (TSV-C), compresses task vectors to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% accuracy. Furthermore, they leverage TSVs to define and reduce \"Singular Task Interference\" (STI), a measure based on the interaction of singular vectors from different tasks. By combining compression with interference reduction, their novel TSV-Merge (TSV-M) approach significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results. An ablation study confirms that both low-rank approximation and interference reduction are crucial for TSV-M's superior performance.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper advocates for structure-aware model manipulation using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on per-layer task matrices, rather than flattened parameter approaches.\n*   TSV-Compress (TSV-C) achieves a 10x compression of task vectors while retaining 99% accuracy by leveraging the low-rank nature of Task Singular Vectors (TSVs).\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) introduces Singular Task Interference (STI) as a metric and reduces it by decorrelating TSVs, significantly outperforming existing model merging techniques.\n*   Ablation studies show that the combination of low-rank approximation and interference reduction in TSV-M is key to its superior performance.",

The core innovation lies in analyzing per-layer task matrices using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), revealing their low-rank nature and defining \"Task Singular Vectors\" (TSVs). This allows for a more nuanced understanding of task interference by examining the geometric alignment of these TSVs.

They also introduce TSV-Merge (TSV-M), which combines TSV-based compression with a novel interference reduction technique (whitening transformation on TSVs) to decorrelate task-specific components. Empirically, TSV-M significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 15% accuracy improvement by effectively mitigating task interference, a problem often exacerbated by flattened parameter approaches. The study demonstrates that both compression and interference reduction are crucial for optimal model merging.\n\n2.

Instead of treating entire models as flattened parameter vectors, the authors delve into the layer-level structure of task-specific weight differences. They leverage Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on these per-layer task matrices, revealing their inherent low-rank nature. This insight leads to two key contributions: TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a method that compresses task vectors by retaining only a small fraction of TSVs, achieving significant storage reduction (10% of original size) while preserving 99% of accuracy. Secondly, TSV-Merge (TSV-M) utilizes TSVs to define and reduce task interference by analyzing the geometric interaction of singular vectors across tasks. By decorrelating TSVs and combining this with low-rank approximation, TSV-M significantly outperforms existing flattened parameter approaches, establishing a new state-of-the-art in model merging by reducing task interference.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Model merging methods that treat entire networks as flattened vectors overlook crucial structural information, leading to susceptibility to task interference.\n*   Analyzing per-layer task matrices via SVD reveals their low-rank nature, allowing for significant compression (TSV-C) while retaining high accuracy.\n*   Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) enable a structure-aware measure of task interference, allowing for its reduction through methods like TSV-Merge (TSV-M).\n*   TSV-M, by combining low-rank approximation with interference reduction, significantly outperforms existing flattened parameter approaches and achieves state-of-the-art results in model merging.",

The core idea is to leverage Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on per-layer task matrices, identifying \"Task Singular Vectors\" (TSVs). The authors demonstrate that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, allowing for efficient compression (TSV-Compress, TSV-C) that retains 99% of accuracy while reducing size by 90%. Crucially, they introduce a novel measure of task interference (Singular Task Interference, STI) based on the interaction of TSVs across tasks. By reducing this interference through orthogonalization of TSVs and combining it with low-rank compression, their TSV-Merge (TSV-M) method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by an average of 15% accuracy. The paper argues that this layer-level, structure-aware manipulation is more effective than global parameter averaging for reducing task interference and improving model merging.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper advocates for structure-aware model manipulation using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices, termed Task Singular Vectors (TSVs), as a superior alternative to flattened parameter approaches.\n*   TSV-Compress (TSV-C) demonstrates that layer task matrices are low-rank, enabling effective compression to 10% of their size while preserving 99% accuracy.\n*   A new measure, Singular Task Interference (STI), is introduced based on the interaction of TSVs, providing a fine-grained way to understand and reduce task conflicts.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines low-rank compression with STI reduction, significantly outperforming existing model merging techniques by reducing interference and improving overall accuracy.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces a structure-aware approach to model merging, moving beyond flattened parameter vectors to leverage the inherent structure of neural networks at the layer level. The core idea is to analyze per-layer task matrices using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), yielding \"Task Singular Vectors\" (TSVs). The authors demonstrate that these task matrices are low-rank, allowing for significant compression (TSV-Compress, TSV-C) while retaining high accuracy. Crucially, they propose a novel measure of task interference based on the interaction of TSVs from different tasks. Building on this, TSV-Merge (TSV-M) is presented, which combines TSV compression with interference reduction by decorrelating TSVs. This structure-aware method significantly outperforms existing flattened parameter approaches, demonstrating substantial accuracy gains and addressing the critical issue of task interference in model merging.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Model merging is advanced by analyzing per-layer task matrices using SVD to extract Task Singular Vectors (TSVs), recognizing their low-rank nature.\n*   TSV-Compress (TSV-C) achieves significant compression (10% of original size) while retaining 99% of accuracy, a key advantage over flattened parameter methods.\n*   A novel measure of task interference (STI) is introduced, based on the interaction of TSVs across layers, offering a more fine-grained analysis than global similarity metrics.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines compression with interference reduction by decorrelating TSVs, leading to state-of-the-art performance in model merging.\n*   The proposed structure-aware approach significantly reduces task interference, a major limitation of flattened parameter methods, resulting in substantial accuracy improvements.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper argues for structure-aware model manipulation by introducing Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices. Unlike flattened parameter approaches that overlook structural information and are prone to task interference, this method analyzes task differences at the layer level. The research demonstrates that these per-layer task matrices are inherently low-rank, allowing for significant compression (TSV-Compress, TSV-C) by retaining only a small fraction of TSVs with minimal accuracy loss. Furthermore, by examining the geometric interactions of TSVs across tasks, the paper defines a measure of task interference (STI). This understanding leads to TSV-Merge (TSV-M), a novel approach that combines compression with interference reduction through a whitening transformation of TSVs. Empirically, TSV-M significantly outperforms existing methods, showcasing the advantage of a structure-aware perspective in model merging.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Analyzing per-layer task matrices using SVD reveals a low-rank structure, enabling efficient compression (TSV-C) with high accuracy retention.\n*   Singular Task Interference (STI) is proposed as a fine-grained measure of inter-task conflicts, derived from the alignment of Task Singular Vectors (TSVs).\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines low-rank compression and interference reduction by decorrelating TSVs, leading to state-of-the-art performance in model merging.\n*   Structure-aware manipulation at the layer level, using TSVs, addresses limitations of flattened parameter approaches, particularly concerning task interference.",

By applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to these per-layer task matrices, the authors identify that they are inherently low-rank. This observation leads to two key contributions: TSV-Compress (TSV-C) for efficient model compression, reducing task vectors to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% accuracy, and TSV-Merge (TSV-M) for improved model merging. TSV-M combines this low-rank compression with a novel measure of task interference, Singular Task Interference (STI), which quantifies the overlap of singular vectors across tasks. By decorrelating these singular vectors through a whitening transformation, TSV-M significantly reduces task interference, outperforming existing methods by an average of 15% accuracy. The study demonstrates that both low-rank approximation and interference reduction are crucial for optimal performance, with the combined approach yielding substantial gains.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Analyzes task vectors at the layer level using SVD, revealing their inherent low-rank nature.\n*   Introduces TSV-Compress (TSV-C) for significant compression (10x) with minimal accuracy loss (99% retention).\n*   Proposes TSV-Merge (TSV-M) that combines low-rank approximation with interference reduction via singular vector decorrelation.\n*   Demonstrates that TSV-M significantly outperforms flattened parameter approaches like Task Arithmetic by reducing task interference.\n*   Highlights the importance of a structure-aware approach for both compression and effective model merging.",

The authors introduce Task Singular Vectors (TSVs), derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices. This layer-level analysis reveals that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs can represent a task's contribution effectively. This insight leads to TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a method that compresses task vectors by 10x while retaining 99% accuracy. Crucially, the interaction between TSVs from different tasks provides a fine-grained measure of task interference. Leveraging this, TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines compression with interference reduction through a whitening transformation of TSVs, significantly outperforming existing methods by reducing task interference and improving overall accuracy. The paper demonstrates that while both low-rank approximation and interference reduction are beneficial, their combination in TSV-M yields the best results.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Model merging methods that treat networks as flat vectors overlook crucial structural information, leading to task interference.\n*   Analyzing per-layer task matrices via SVD reveals a low-rank structure, allowing for compression into Task Singular Vectors (TSVs).\n*   TSV-Compress (TSV-C) compresses task vectors by 10x while retaining 99% accuracy.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) utilizes TSVs to define and reduce task interference, significantly outperforming flattened parameter approaches.\n*   The combination of low-rank approximation and interference reduction in TSV-M offers the most substantial performance improvements.",

It introduces Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices. The authors demonstrate that these layer-wise task matrices are inherently low-rank, allowing for significant compression (TSV-Compress, TSV-C) with minimal accuracy loss (retaining 99% accuracy while compressing to 10% of original size). Crucially, by analyzing the interaction of TSVs across tasks, the paper defines a measure of task interference (Singular Task Interference, STI) and proposes a novel model merging technique, TSV-Merge (TSV-M). TSV-M combines TSV-C's compression with interference reduction through a whitening transformation of TSVs, leading to substantial performance improvements over existing methods by mitigating cross-task conflicts at the layer level. The ablation studies confirm that both low-rank approximation and interference reduction are vital for TSV-M's success, with the combined approach outperforming methods that only employ one.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Per-layer analysis of task matrices using SVD reveals a low-rank structure, enabling efficient compression (TSV-Compress) while retaining high accuracy.\n*   Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) are introduced as a means to analyze and reduce task interference by examining the geometric relationships between layer-specific weight changes.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines low-rank compression with interference reduction via TSV orthogonalization, significantly outperforming flattened parameter approaches.\n*   An ablation study demonstrates that both low-rank approximation and interference reduction are crucial for TSV-M's superior performance.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) as a structure-aware approach to model merging, directly addressing the limitations of flattened parameter methods like Task Arithmetic. By analyzing the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices, the authors reveal their inherent low-rank nature. This insight enables TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a method that compresses task vectors to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% of accuracy, offering a significant reduction in storage. Crucially, the paper proposes TSV-Merge (TSV-M), which leverages TSVs not only for compression but also for reducing task interference. This is achieved by decorrelating TSVs from different tasks using a whitening transformation. TSV-M significantly outperforms existing model merging techniques, demonstrating the advantage of understanding and manipulating the structure within model layers rather than treating parameters as a flat vector. The approach also shows that interference reduction is most effective when applied to low-rank approximations, leading to state-of-the-art performance in model merging.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper advocates for a structure-aware approach to model merging by analyzing per-layer task matrices using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), contrasting with flattened parameter methods.\n*   TSV-Compress (TSV-C) leverages the low-rank property of layer task matrices to achieve significant compression (10% of original size) with minimal accuracy loss (99% retained).\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines this compression with a novel method for reducing task interference by decorrelating Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) via whitening, leading to state-of-the-art performance.\n*   The proposed Singular Task Interference (STI) metric, based on the interaction of TSVs, provides a fine-grained understanding of inter-task conflicts, which are mitigated by TSV-M.\n*   Ablation studies confirm that combining low-rank approximation with interference reduction yields the best results, highlighting the benefit of a structure-aware approach.",

The authors introduce Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices. They demonstrate that these layer-wise task matrices are inherently low-rank, allowing for significant compression (TSV-Compress or TSV-C) with minimal accuracy loss (retaining 99% accuracy while reducing size by 90%). Crucially, the TSVs provide a means to quantify and reduce task interference. By analyzing the geometric interaction of singular vectors across tasks, they develop a new measure of interference. Their proposed model merging approach, TSV-Merge (TSV-M), combines this compression with interference reduction through a whitening transformation, outperforming existing methods by a substantial margin. This structure-aware manipulation effectively addresses task interference, a key limitation of flattened parameter approaches.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Per-layer task matrices exhibit low-rank properties, enabling compression via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) into Task Singular Vectors (TSVs).\n*   TSV-Compress (TSV-C) achieves significant compression (90% reduction) while retaining high accuracy (99%).\n*   Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) enable a fine-grained, layer-level measure of task interference.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines compression with interference reduction using TSVs and whitening, outperforming flattened parameter approaches.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces a structure-aware approach to model merging that moves beyond flattened parameter vectors. The authors propose analyzing per-layer task matrices using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract Task Singular Vectors (TSVs). They demonstrate that these layer task matrices are inherently low-rank, allowing for significant compression (TSV-Compress, TSV-C) by retaining only a small fraction of TSVs while maintaining high accuracy. Crucially, the interaction between TSVs from different tasks is analyzed to quantify and reduce task interference. This leads to TSV-Merge (TSV-M), a novel method that combines TSV-C's compression with a whitening transformation on TSVs to decorrelate them, thereby minimizing task interference. TSV-M significantly outperforms existing methods like Task Arithmetic and Consensus TA, achieving state-of-the-art results by effectively managing task interference, which is shown to be higher in earlier layers and decreases in more specialized, deeper layers. The approach offers a more efficient and effective way to merge models by respecting their inherent structure.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Analyzes per-layer task matrices using SVD to extract Task Singular Vectors (TSVs), treating models with a structure-aware perspective rather than flattened vectors.\n*   Proposes TSV-Compress (TSV-C) for significant model compression (reducing task vectors to 10% of original size) while retaining 99% accuracy, leveraging the low-rank nature of layer task matrices.\n*   Introduces TSV-Merge (TSV-M) which combines compression with interference reduction by decorrelating TSVs, leading to substantial performance gains over existing methods like Task Arithmetic and Consensus TA.\n*   Defines and utilizes Singular Task Interference (STI) as a layer-level metric, showing that interference is higher in early layers and decreases in deeper layers, and that reducing it is key to improved merging performance.",
