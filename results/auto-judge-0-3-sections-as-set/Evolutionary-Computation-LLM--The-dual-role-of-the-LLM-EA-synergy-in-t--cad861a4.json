      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThe synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) offers significant potential for enhancing model and code security. EAs can bolster LLM security by being used for prompt generation specifically aimed at identifying vulnerabilities (e.g., jailbreak attacks) and testing the robustness of LLM-generated text detectors. Conversely, LLMs can aid EAs in developing more secure code by generating code that adheres to security principles or by identifying potential vulnerabilities in generated code. The paper highlights that EA-based prompt engineering can be used for security-related tasks like automatically generating jailbreak prompts (AutoDAN) or optimizing system messages to resist such attacks (SMEA). Furthermore, LLMs can be integrated with EAs to improve code security by generating code with specified vulnerabilities (DeceptPrompt) or by enforcing syntax rules to reduce security threats. This dual role demonstrates how their combined capabilities can be leveraged to both probe and strengthen the security of AI systems and software.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   EAs can be utilized for prompt generation to identify LLM vulnerabilities, such as in \"jailbreak attacks\" (e.g., AutoDAN) and to test the robustness of LLM security detection systems.\n*   LLMs can assist EAs in generating more secure code by creating code that adheres to security standards or by identifying potential vulnerabilities in code.\n*   The paper mentions specific methods like DeceptPrompt that use EAs to optimize natural language instructions for code generation models to produce code with specified vulnerabilities.\n*   LLMs can also be used in conjunction with EAs to improve code security by generating code that adheres to syntax rules, thereby reducing security risks.\n*   The synergy allows for the exploration of adversarial prompting and the development of more resilient LLM-based systems.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThe synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) plays a crucial role in enhancing model and code security. In code generation, this synergy is applied to identify and introduce vulnerabilities. DeceptPrompt uses an EA, with the LLM acting as a mutation operator, to optimize adversarial natural language instructions (prefixes/suffixes) that lead code generation models to produce code with specified vulnerabilities while retaining functionality. The fitness function balances functional correctness and vulnerability injection. In contrast, G3P with LLM aims to enhance security by ensuring generated code adheres to syntax rules, using LLM to create the initial population, which is then evolved by G3P. For LLM security through prompt generation, AutoDAN uses an EA to automatically generate \"jailbreak\" prompts, which can exploit aligned LLMs. This EA employs a hierarchical GA to optimize prompts at both sentence and vocabulary levels, incorporating a momentum word scoring mechanism for a balance between search ability and semantic coherence. In software testing, TitanFuzz leverages LLMs pre-trained on code for fuzzing deep learning libraries. Specifically, it uses LLM's generative ability (Codex) for seed generation and infilling ability (InCoder) for mutation generation to create test inputs. The EA's role is implicit in the iterative process of generating and evaluating these inputs based on a fitness function that considers dataflow graph depth and API calls.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   DeceptPrompt uses an EA with LLM as a mutation operator to inject specific vulnerabilities into generated code, balancing functionality and security flaws.\n*   G3P with LLM enhances code security by ensuring syntactical correctness through LLM-generated initial populations and subsequent EA evolution.\n*   AutoDAN employs a hierarchical GA for prompt generation to find jailbreak vulnerabilities in LLMs, optimizing prompts at multiple linguistic levels.\n*   TitanFuzz utilizes LLMs for fuzzing deep learning libraries, with LLMs generating test seeds and mutations, and an implicit EA guiding the process based on code complexity metrics.",

In code generation, LLMs can be guided by EAs to produce code with specific vulnerabilities, as demonstrated by DeceptPrompt, which uses GA to optimize adversarial prompts for injecting flaws. Conversely, G3P with LLM enhances security by using LLMs to generate initial code populations that are then refined by Grammatical Evolution to adhere to syntax, reducing security threats. Within LLM security, AutoDAN employs a hierarchical GA to optimize jailbreak prompts, addressing sentence and vocabulary levels to bypass alignment. EA-based prompt engineering, while generally improving LLM outputs, also extends to security testing, enabling adversarial attacks and defenses. In software testing, TitanFuzz leverages LLMs (Codex, InCoder) for seed and mutation generation, with EAs guiding the process for deep learning libraries. The broader application of LLM-assisted optimization algorithm generation by EAs indirectly contributes to security by creating more robust and potentially secure algorithms.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs and EAs can be combined to deliberately inject vulnerabilities into generated code (DeceptPrompt) or ensure code adheres to syntax to prevent threats (G3P with LLM).\n*   AutoDAN utilizes a hierarchical GA to optimize prompts for jailbreaking LLMs, targeting both sentence and vocabulary levels for effective adversarial attacks.\n*   In software testing, TitanFuzz uses LLMs for code generation within deep learning libraries, with EAs orchestrating the process to improve test coverage and uncover bugs.\n*   EA-enhanced prompt engineering extends to LLM security by facilitating adversarial attacks and improving defenses against them.",

In prompt generation for LLM security, EAs like Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are employed to create \"jailbreak\" attacks. AutoDAN, for instance, uses a hierarchical GA to optimize prompts at both sentence and vocabulary levels, while SMEA focuses on evolving system messages to resist jailbreaking. For code generation security, LLM+EA combinations are used to inject vulnerabilities. DeceptPrompt uses a GA with LLMs as mutation operators to generate code with specified vulnerabilities while maintaining functionality. In contrast, G3P with LLMs uses LLMs to generate initial code populations, which are then evolved by G3P under BNF syntax constraints to improve security. For software testing, TitanFuzz leverages LLMs for seed and mutation generation in deep learning libraries, with EAs guiding the process based on dataflow depth and API calls. CodaMOSA uses EAs to reach coverage plateaus before employing LLMs to generate new test cases for low-coverage functions.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   EAs, particularly GAs and hierarchical GAs, are used in prompt generation for LLM security to create adversarial inputs (e.g., AutoDAN, SMEA).\n*   In code generation security, LLM-EA synergies (DeceptPrompt, G3P) are employed to either inject vulnerabilities into code or ensure generated code adheres to secure syntax.\n*   For deep learning library testing, TitanFuzz uses LLMs for test case generation and EAs for guiding the fuzzing process based on code complexity metrics.\n*   EA-based LLM architecture search aims to optimize LLM designs for better performance and efficiency, indirectly contributing to security by potentially creating more robust models.",

For LLM security, EA-based prompt engineering is utilized for \"jailbreak attacks\" to test robustness. AutoDAN employs a hierarchical GA to optimize prompts at vocabulary and sentence levels for these attacks. SMEA, on the other hand, searches for system messages to enhance resistance against jailbreaking. In code generation security, DeceptPrompt uses a GA with LLM as a mutation operator to inject specific vulnerabilities into functionally correct code, aiming to evaluate the security of generated code. G3P with LLM enhances code security by ensuring generated programs adhere to BNF syntax, reducing the likelihood of threats. TitanFuzz leverages LLMs for seed and mutation generation within deep learning libraries for fuzzing, with the EA guiding the process based on dataflow graph depth and API calls.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   EA-based prompt engineering, specifically AutoDAN and SMEA, is used to probe LLM security by generating jailbreak prompts and enhancing defenses.\n*   In code generation, DeceptPrompt uses a GA and LLM to inject vulnerabilities, while G3P with LLM ensures syntactic correctness for improved security.\n*   TitanFuzz employs LLM/EA synergy for fuzz testing of deep learning libraries, with EA guiding input generation based on structural and API complexity.\n*   The integrated synergy of LLMs and EAs is applied to software testing and code generation to enhance security by identifying vulnerabilities or ensuring robust code.",
