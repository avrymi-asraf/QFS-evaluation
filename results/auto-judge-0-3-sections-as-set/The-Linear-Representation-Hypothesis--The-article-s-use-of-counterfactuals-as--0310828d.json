The authors introduce counterfactuals as a formal language to define linear representations in both input (context) and output (word) spaces. They demonstrate that these notions connect to model intervention and measurement, respectively. A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which is designed such that causally separable concepts are represented orthogonally. This causal inner product is shown to unify the input and output linear representations. The research utilizes counterfactual pairs to derive these representations and the causal inner product, which are then empirically validated using LLaMA-2. Experiments confirm the existence of linear representations for concepts, the connection to interpretation (measurement) and control (intervention), and the crucial role of the chosen inner product in respecting semantic structure.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactuals are used as a formal language to define linear representations of concepts in LLMs, connecting input and output spaces.\n*   The paper introduces a \"causal inner product\" that represents causally separable concepts as orthogonal vectors, unifying different notions of linear representation.\n*   This causal inner product allows for the construction of both measurement (probing) and intervention (steering) representations from counterfactual data.\n*   Empirical results with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of these linear representations and validate the proposed causal inner product's ability to capture semantic structure.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" proposing that high-level concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) are represented linearly within the model's embedding space. The authors introduce counterfactuals as a formal language to define these linear representations, distinguishing between \"unembedding\" and \"embedding\" representations. The unembedding representation, defined by the difference between counterfactual word embeddings (e.g., γ(\"queen\") - γ(\"king\")), is highlighted as an ideal probing representation because it captures the core concept without being influenced by correlated but off-target concepts. The paper then introduces a \"causal inner product\" that enforces orthogonality between causally separable concepts. This inner product provides a mathematical isomorphism that unifies the distinct unembedding and embedding representations. The conditions for embedding representations are detailed, requiring that counterfactual context embeddings differ along the concept direction while remaining invariant to causally separable concepts. The geometric object of interest is the difference between unembedding vectors of counterfactual pairs, which forms a cone representing the concept direction. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the validity of these formalizations, showing that the causal inner product respects semantic structure and enables unified representation manipulation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   **Unembedding Representation as Ideal Probing:** The unembedding representation, derived from differences in counterfactual word embeddings (e.g., γ(y1) - γ(y0)), is posited as an ideal probing representation because it isolates the concept of interest from other correlated factors.\n*   **Unification via Causal Inner Product:** A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which enforces orthogonality between representations of causally separable concepts. This specific inner product establishes a mathematical isomorphism that unifies the distinct unembedding and embedding representations.\n*   **Conditions for Embedding Representations:** Embedding representations are formally defined by requiring that differences between specific counterfactual context embeddings are aligned with a concept direction and, crucially, remain invariant with respect to causally separable concepts.\n*   **Geometric Object: Difference of Unembedding Vectors:** The core geometric object representing a concept is the difference between unembedding vectors of counterfactual word pairs (e.g., γ(\"queen\") - γ(\"king\")), which defines a directional cone in the representation space.",

It defines \"linear representation\" in two ways: as an \"unembedding representation\" in the output space, which connects to measurement (linear probing), and as an \"embedding representation\" in the input space, which connects to intervention (model steering). The core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product\" that makes causally separable concepts orthogonal. This inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations through a Riesz isomorphism, enabling the construction of intervention vectors from unembedding representations. The paper addresses the unidentifiability of the inner product by proposing a solution based on statistical independence assumptions. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these concepts, showing that counterfactual differences align with unembedding representations, that causally separable concepts are orthogonal under the estimated causal inner product, and that these representations can indeed be used for interpretation (measurement) and control (intervention).\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactuals are used to formally define unembedding representations (linking to measurement) and embedding representations (linking to intervention).\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which makes causally separable concepts orthogonal and unifies embedding and unembedding representations via a Riesz isomorphism.\n*   The paper provides a method to estimate the causal inner product, addressing its inherent unidentifiability, and demonstrates its effectiveness with LLaMA-2 experiments.\n*   Unembedding representations are presented as ideal probing representations, and embedding representations, derived via the causal inner product, enable concept intervention.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" which posits that high-level concepts in large language models are represented linearly as directions within a representation space. The authors introduce counterfactual pairs of language outputs to formally define linear representations in both the \"unembedding\" (output word) space and the \"embedding\" (input context) space. They demonstrate that unembedding representations connect to the \"measurement\" notion (predicting concepts with linear probes), while embedding representations relate to \"intervention\" (manipulating concepts by adding vectors). A key contribution is the concept of a \"causal inner product,\" defined such that causally separable concepts are orthogonal. This specific inner product is shown to unify the embedding and unembedding representations through a mathematical isomorphism, allowing for a consistent geometric interpretation. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these findings, showing that estimated causal inner products respect semantic structure and enable both interpretation (measurement) and control (intervention) of model behavior. The work addresses the challenge of inner product unidentifiability by proposing an estimation method based on statistical dependencies between words.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactual pairs are used to formally define linear representations in both embedding and unembedding spaces, linking them to measurement and intervention, respectively.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, where causally separable concepts are represented as orthogonal vectors, unifying embedding and unembedding representations via a Riesz isomorphism.\n*   The unembedding representation is shown to be an \"ideal probing representation,\" connecting it to the measurement notion of linear representation.\n*   Experiments on LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of linear representations for concepts and validate the properties of the causal inner product, showing its utility for interpretation and control.\n*   The paper addresses the unidentifiability of the inner product by proposing an estimation method based on statistical independence assumptions between causally separable concepts.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" suggesting high-level concepts are represented linearly in LLMs. It uses counterfactuals as a formal language to define and connect different intuitions about these representations. The authors distinguish between \"unembedding representations\" (in the output space) and \"embedding representations\" (in the input space). Unembedding representations are shown to be closely tied to the \"measurement\" notion, acting as ideal linear probes that capture concept variation without spurious correlations. Embedding representations, defined by specific counterfactual context conditions, are linked to \"intervention\" by allowing controlled manipulation of model outputs. A key contribution is the concept of a \"causal inner product,\" which, when applied to unembedding representations, unifies them with embedding representations through a mathematical isomorphism. This inner product is estimated based on the assumption that causally separable concepts are uncorrelated in the representation space. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and demonstrate that the causal inner product respects semantic structure, outperforming the Euclidean inner product in capturing concept orthogonality.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactuals provide a formal language to define and connect \"unembedding\" (output space) and \"embedding\" (input space) representations of concepts.\n*   Unembedding representations act as ideal linear probes for \"measurement\" by isolating concept variation, while embedding representations facilitate \"intervention\" via specific counterfactual context conditions.\n*   A \"causal inner product,\" derived from the principle that causally separable concepts are orthogonal, unifies embedding and unembedding representations through a Riesz isomorphism.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and show the causal inner product effectively captures semantic structure, outperforming the Euclidean inner product.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" proposing that high-level concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) are represented linearly in their embedding spaces. The authors introduce counterfactual pairs as a formal language to define linear representations in both output (unembedding) and input (embedding) spaces. They demonstrate that unembedding representations connect to \"measurement\" (akin to linear probing), while embedding representations relate to \"intervention\" (model steering). A key contribution is the definition of a \"causal inner product\" that respects the causal separability of concepts, meaning causally independent concepts are represented orthogonally. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations through a mathematical isomorphism, allowing for geometric notions like similarity and projection to be semantically meaningful. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these formalizations, showing that concept directions align with unembedding representations and that the causal inner product effectively captures semantic structure by making causally separable concepts orthogonal, outperforming the standard Euclidean inner product.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactual pairs provide a formal language to define linear representations in both unembedding and embedding spaces, linking them to measurement and intervention respectively.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, where causally separable concepts are represented orthogonally, unifying embedding and unembedding representations via a Riesz isomorphism.\n*   The causal inner product is estimated using word statistics and shown to capture semantic structure, making causally separable concepts orthogonal, and outperforms the Euclidean inner product in LLaMA-2 experiments.\n*   Unembedding representations serve as \"ideal probing representations\" because they are tied to counterfactuals without incorporating off-target information, unlike standard linear probes.",

The authors introduce counterfactual pairs as a formal language to define linear representations in both \"unembedding\" (output word) and \"embedding\" (input context) spaces. They demonstrate that unembedding representations connect to \"measurement\" (probing), with the unembedding representation serving as an ideal probing mechanism due to its focus on concept-specific variations rather than spurious correlations. Embedding representations, defined by specific conditions on counterfactual context embeddings, are shown to relate to \"intervention\" (model steering). A key contribution is the definition of a \"causal inner product\" that makes causally separable concepts orthogonal. This inner product unifies embedding and unembedding representations through a mathematical isomorphism, allowing the construction of intervention representations from unembedding representations. Experiments with LLaMA-2 empirically validate these formalizations, showing that concepts are indeed represented linearly and that the causal inner product respects semantic structure, outperforming the Euclidean inner product in capturing these relationships.\n\n2.

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" which posits that high-level concepts are represented linearly within language models. The authors propose using counterfactuals as a formal language to define these representations. They introduce two formalizations: one for \"unembedding representations\" in the output space, which connects to measurement (probing), and another for \"embedding representations\" in the input space, linked to intervention (steering). A key contribution is the definition of a \"causal inner product\" that treats causally separable concepts as orthogonal. This inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations through a Riesz isomorphism, allowing for the construction of intervention vectors from unembedding representations. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these concepts, demonstrating that counterfactual pairs indeed define linear subspaces in the unembedding space, and the estimated causal inner product respects semantic structure, showing approximate orthogonality for causally separable concepts. The unembedding representations are shown to act as ideal linear probes, and interventions using derived embedding representations effectively control model behavior.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactual pairs are used to formally define linear representations in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces.\n*   Unembedding representations, derived from counterfactual word pairs, serve as ideal linear probes for concepts.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which treats causally separable concepts as orthogonal, unifying embedding and unembedding representations via a Riesz isomorphism.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear representations, the empirical properties of the causal inner product (orthogonality for separable concepts), and the connection between representations and model control (intervention).",

It proposes two formalizations: \"unembedding representations\" in the output space and \"embedding representations\" in the input space. The authors demonstrate that unembedding representations are ideally suited for measurement tasks (like probing) because they capture concept direction without being confounded by other factors. Conversely, embedding representations are linked to intervention tasks, allowing controlled manipulation of model behavior. A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which establishes orthogonality between causally separable concepts. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations through a mathematical isomorphism. The paper provides an explicit method for estimating this inner product and empirically validates these concepts and the inner product's properties using LLaMA-2, showing that causally separable concepts are indeed orthogonal under this metric, unlike the Euclidean inner product.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactual pairs are used to formally define \"unembedding\" and \"embedding\" representations of concepts in LLMs.\n*   Unembedding representations are shown to be ideal for measurement (probing) as they isolate concept-specific directions.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, formalizing the idea that causally separable concepts should be orthogonal, and this product unifies embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate that causally separable concepts exhibit approximate orthogonality under the estimated causal inner product, a property not consistently held by the Euclidean inner product.",

The authors introduce counterfactual pairs as a formal language to define linear representations in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces. They demonstrate that the unembedding representation is closely tied to the \"measurement\" notion (linear probing), offering an ideal probing representation because it isolates the concept of interest without confounds. Conversely, the embedding representation is linked to the \"intervention\" notion (model steering), enabling controlled manipulation of model behavior. A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product\" that treats causally separable concepts as orthogonal. This inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations through a Riesz isomorphism, allowing for the construction of intervention representations from unembedding representations. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these theoretical connections, showing that concepts are indeed represented linearly as directions and that the causal inner product respects semantic structure, outperforming the Euclidean inner product in capturing these relationships.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" proposing that high-level concepts in language models are represented linearly in their representation spaces. The authors introduce counterfactuals as a formal language to define linear representations in both output (unembedding) and input (embedding) spaces. They demonstrate that unembedding representations connect to measurement (probing), and embedding representations connect to intervention (model steering). A key contribution is the concept of a \"causal inner product,\" which respects the semantic structure of language by making causally separable concepts orthogonal. This inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, enabling the construction of probes and steering vectors from counterfactual pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations, the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic structure, and its role in bridging measurement and intervention. The work highlights the crucial role of the inner product choice in interpreting and controlling LLMs.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactuals are used to formally define linear representations in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces, connecting them to model control (intervention) and interpretation (measurement), respectively.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, defined by orthogonality between causally separable concepts, which unifies embedding and unembedding representations through a mathematical isomorphism.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 empirically validate the existence of linear concept representations and demonstrate that the causal inner product captures semantic structure, aligning causally separable concepts orthogonally.\n*   The unembedding representation is identified as an ideal probing representation, and embedding representations, derived via the causal inner product, are shown to enable model steering without optimization.",

The authors use counterfactual pairs—pairs of inputs that differ only in a specific conceptual dimension—as a formal language to define linear representations in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces. They demonstrate that these formalizations connect to \"measurement\" (predicting output based on representation) and \"intervention\" (steering model behavior), respectively. A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which is designed such that causally separable concepts are orthogonal. This inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations through a Riesz isomorphism. The paper provides an explicit form for this causal inner product and empirically validates these concepts using LLaMA-2, showing that the causal inner product respects semantic structure and enables both interpretation (as probes) and control (via intervention). The work highlights the crucial role of the inner product choice in making geometric notions meaningful for understanding LLM representations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactual pairs are used as a formal language to define linear representations in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces.\n*   Unembedding representations serve as ideal \"measurement\" (probing) representations, while embedding representations link to \"intervention\" (model steering).\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, where causally separable concepts are orthogonal, unifying embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear representations and demonstrate that the estimated causal inner product captures semantic structure and enables interpretation and control.",

The authors introduce counterfactual pairs as a formal language to define linear representations in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces. They establish connections between these formalizations and practical LLM tasks: unembedding representations link to measurement (probing), and embedding representations link to intervention (model steering). A key contribution is the concept of a \"causal inner product,\" an inner product that treats causally separable concepts as orthogonal. This causal inner product is shown to unify the embedding and unembedding representations through a Riesz isomorphism, effectively bridging the gap between measurement and intervention. The paper also outlines methods for estimating this causal inner product, demonstrating its empirical validity with LLaMA-2. Experiments confirm that concepts are indeed represented linearly, that the causal inner product respects semantic structure by enforcing orthogonality for separable concepts, and that these representations can be used for both interpretation and control.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactual pairs provide a formal language to define linear representations for concepts in LLMs, connecting them to both output (unembedding) and input (embedding) spaces.\n*   Unembedding representations are identified as \"ideal probing representations\" for measurement, while embedding representations are linked to intervention for model control.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, defined by orthogonality between causally separable concepts, which unifies embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   Empirical validation with LLaMA-2 demonstrates the existence of linear concept representations and shows that the estimated causal inner product captures semantic structure, outperforming the Euclidean inner product.",

The authors use counterfactuals as a formal language to define these linear representations in both the input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces. They demonstrate that unembedding representations, defined by differences in output word representations from counterfactual pairs, serve as ideal linear probes for measurement. Conversely, embedding representations, derived from context embeddings that vary a concept while keeping others constant, are linked to intervention (model steering). A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product\" that makes causally separable concepts orthogonal. This inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, providing a geometric framework to understand and manipulate concepts within LLMs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 empirically validate these formalizations, showing that concepts are indeed represented linearly and that the causal inner product respects semantic structure, enabling both interpretation and control.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactual pairs are used to formally define linear representations in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces of LLMs.\n*   Unembedding representations, derived from output vector differences of counterfactuals, act as ideal linear probes for concept measurement.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, making causally separable concepts orthogonal, and it unifies embedding and unembedding representations, enabling geometric analysis.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and the properties of the causal inner product for concept interpretation and control.",
