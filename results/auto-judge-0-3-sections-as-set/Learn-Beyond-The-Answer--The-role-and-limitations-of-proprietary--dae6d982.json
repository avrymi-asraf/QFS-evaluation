Unlike traditional data augmentation methods that expand the training dataset by creating new problems or re-sampling answers, RefAug enriches existing training instances by appending a \"reflective section.\" This section includes alternative reasoning pathways and follow-up extensions (abstraction or analogy) of the original problem and its solution. The core idea is to move beyond superficial pattern matching and foster a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and problem-solving methodologies. Experiments show that RefAug not only improves performance on standard single-round question-answering tasks but also significantly boosts capabilities in more complex, reflective reasoning scenarios where other augmentation methods fall short. Furthermore, RefAug is complementary to existing augmentation techniques, yielding synergistic gains. The authors used proprietary models like GPT-4 for data annotation, acknowledging that stronger open-source models could reduce this dependency.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) enhances LLM mathematical reasoning by embedding alternative and follow-up reasoning into training data.\n*   RefAug improves performance on both standard single-round QA and complex reflective reasoning tasks, unlike traditional augmentation methods that focus on data quantity.\n*   The method is complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to further performance gains when combined.\n*   Proprietary models like GPT-4 were used for annotating the reflective sections, highlighting a reliance on such models for high-quality synthetic data.\n*   The effectiveness of RefAug extends beyond math to code generation, demonstrating the general applicability of incorporating reflective processes in training.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces \"Reflective Augmentation\" (RefAug), a novel technique for training Large Language Models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning by embedding problem reflection into training instances. Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the dataset by adding more examples, RefAug operates on the sequence dimension by appending a \"reflective section\" to existing answers. This section includes alternative reasoning approaches and follow-up reasoning (abstraction or analogy), encouraging deeper understanding and flexible application of concepts. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance not only in standard single-round question-answering tasks but also in more complex reflective reasoning scenarios where standard augmentation methods falter. RefAug is shown to be complementary to existing data expansion techniques, yielding further substantial gains when combined. The study also explores its effectiveness in code generation, highlighting reflection as a crucial capability for LLMs across different domains. While proprietary models like GPT-4 are used for data annotation, the research acknowledges the potential for stronger open-source models to reduce reliance on paid services.\n\n2.

Unlike traditional data augmentation that increases the quantity of training instances, RefAug enriches each instance by appending a \"reflective section\" that encourages the LLM to consider alternative perspectives and follow-up extensions of the problem. This method aims to foster deeper understanding beyond superficial pattern matching, improving performance on both standard single-round question-answering tasks and more complex reflective reasoning scenarios (e.g., error correction, follow-up questions). Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts accuracy, complements existing augmentation strategies, and even shows promise in code generation tasks. The study also highlights the role of proprietary expert models like GPT-4-turbo in generating high-quality reflective data, though it notes limitations related to budget constraints for scaling such data generation and acknowledges that open-source models, while improving, have not yet matched the quality of proprietary models for generating data that enhances advanced reflective reasoning.\n\n2.
