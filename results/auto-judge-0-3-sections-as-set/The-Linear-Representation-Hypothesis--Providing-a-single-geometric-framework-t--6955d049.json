SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" which posits that high-level concepts in language models are represented as linear directions within their representation spaces. It provides a unified geometric framework that connects the subspace hypothesis (e.g., word2vec analogies) with practical techniques like linear probing and activation steering. The authors introduce formal definitions of linear representations based on counterfactual pairs in both the input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces. They demonstrate that unembedding representations correspond to measurement capabilities (linear probing), while embedding representations relate to intervention capabilities (activation steering). A key contribution is the definition of a \"causal inner product\" which, when estimated, establishes orthogonality between causally separable concepts. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, providing a consistent geometric foundation. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these theoretical connections, showing that estimated concept directions align with linear probes and can be used for effective model steering.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis\" by defining linear representations in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces using counterfactual pairs.\n*   Unembedding representations are shown to connect to linear probing (measurement), while embedding representations connect to activation steering (intervention).\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which makes causally separable concepts orthogonal, unifying embedding and unembedding representations into a single geometric framework.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 empirically support the existence of these linear representations and the effectiveness of the causal inner product for connecting interpretation (probing) and control (steering).",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis\" by proposing a geometric framework that connects high-level concepts to linear directions in a language model's representation space. It defines \"linear representation\" through counterfactual pairs, distinguishing between \"unembedding representations\" (linked to measurement/probing) and \"embedding representations\" (linked to intervention/steering). A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which, when applied to unembedding representations of causally separable concepts, results in orthogonality. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for the construction of intervention vectors from unembedding representations and enabling geometric analysis. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and the utility of the causal inner product, demonstrating its superiority over the Euclidean inner product in capturing semantic structure and causal separability.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formally defines \"linear representation\" using counterfactual pairs, linking concepts to directions in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which establishes orthogonality between representations of causally separable concepts and unifies embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear representations and demonstrate that the causal inner product effectively captures semantic structure and causal separability, outperforming the Euclidean inner product.\n*   The formalization connects unembedding representations to linear probing (measurement) and embedding representations to activation steering (intervention).",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper provides a geometric framework to formally connect the \"subspace hypothesis\" (e.g., word2vec analogies) with practical LLM interpretation and control techniques like linear probing and activation steering. It formalizes linear representation using counterfactual pairs, defining \"unembedding representations\" that connect to measurement (linear probing) and \"embedding representations\" that connect to intervention (activation steering). The core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which respects the causal separability of concepts by making their representations orthogonal. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for a single geometric understanding. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these formalizations, demonstrating that concepts are indeed represented linearly, that the causal inner product captures semantic structure (unlike the Euclidean inner product in some cases), and that these linear representations can be used for both probing and steering. The work clarifies that while the Euclidean inner product may sometimes align with semantic orthogonality, the causal inner product is theoretically grounded for this purpose.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" which posits that high-level concepts in large language models (LLMs) are represented as linear directions in their representation spaces. It establishes a geometric framework that formally connects the subspace hypothesis (like word2vec analogies) with practical techniques of linear probing and activation steering. The authors introduce two formalizations of linear representation using counterfactual pairs: one in the output (unembedding) space, linking to measurement (linear probing), and another in the input (embedding) space, linking to intervention (activation steering). A key contribution is the definition of a \"causal inner product,\" which, when applied to unembedding representations of causally separable concepts, results in orthogonality. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for the construction of steering vectors from subspace representations. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these theoretical connections, demonstrating that concepts are indeed linearly represented and that the causal inner product captures semantic structure better than the Euclidean inner product, enabling effective model control.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" which posits that high-level concepts are represented as linear directions in a model's representation space. It provides two formalizations of linear representation: one in the output (unembedding) space, linked to measurement (linear probing), and another in the input (embedding) space, linked to intervention (activation steering). The core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which respects the semantic independence of concepts by treating them as orthogonal directions. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for the construction of probes and steering vectors using counterfactual word pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations, demonstrate the causal inner product's ability to capture semantic structure through orthogonality, and confirm that these representations can be used for both interpretation (measurement) and control (intervention). The paper highlights that while the Euclidean inner product offers some approximation, the causal inner product is crucial for a semantically meaningful geometric framework.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formally connects the \"subspace hypothesis\" (e.g., word2vec analogies) with linear probing (measurement) and activation steering (intervention) through two formalizations of linear representation.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which treats causally separable concepts as orthogonal directions, unifying embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   This causal inner product allows for the construction of probes and steering vectors using counterfactual pairs and is empirically validated with LLaMA-2, showing it captures semantic structure better than the Euclidean inner product.\n*   The work demonstrates that unembedding representations directly relate to measurement (linear probing), while embedding representations relate to intervention (activation steering).",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper provides a geometric framework to unify the subspace hypothesis (e.g., word2vec analogies) with practical techniques like linear probing and activation steering. It formalizes \"linear representation\" using counterfactual pairs in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces. The core contribution is the definition of a \"causal inner product,\" which respects the causal separability of concepts. This causal inner product is shown to unify the embedding and unembedding representations, meaning that causally separable concepts become orthogonal in this unified space. This unification is crucial because it allows the construction of intervention representations from the more readily estimable unembedding representations. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear representations, demonstrate that the causal inner product captures semantic structure, and show how these representations connect to both measurement (linear probing) and intervention (activation steering). The paper highlights that while the Euclidean inner product sometimes shows partial orthogonality, the causal inner product is essential for a semantically meaningful geometric understanding and control of LLMs.\n\n2.

It proposes a single geometric framework that unifies different interpretations of linear representation: subspace, measurement, and intervention. The core of this framework is the \"causal inner product,\" defined by the principle that causally separable concepts should be orthogonal. This causal inner product is shown to unify the \"unembedding\" representations (linked to measurement via linear probing) and \"embedding\" representations (linked to intervention via activation steering). The authors derive an explicit form for this inner product and validate their findings using LLaMA-2. Experiments demonstrate that concepts are indeed represented linearly as directions in the unembedding space, that the estimated causal inner product respects causal separability, and that these concept directions function as effective linear probes and can be used for intervention. The work clarifies the critical role of the inner product in making geometric notions semantically meaningful and contrasts the causal inner product with the Euclidean inner product, showing its advantages in capturing semantic structure.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A formal geometric framework is introduced to connect the subspace hypothesis (e.g., word2vec analogies) with linear probing (measurement) and activation steering (intervention).\n*   The \"causal inner product\" is defined as an inner product where causally separable concepts are orthogonal, and this inner product unifies embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear concept representations, the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic structure, and the utility of concept directions for both probing and steering.\n*   The paper demonstrates that concept directions derived from unembedding representations can be directly used to construct intervention representations, enabling controlled manipulation of model behavior.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper provides a geometric framework that formally connects the subspace hypothesis (as seen in word2vec analogies) with practical LLM interpretation and control techniques like linear probing and activation steering. The authors define \"linear representation\" through counterfactual pairs, establishing two formalizations: one in the output (unembedding) space linked to measurement, and another in the input (embedding) space linked to intervention. A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which formalizes the idea that causally separable concepts should be orthogonal. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, enabling the construction of probes and steering vectors from counterfactual pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations, demonstrate the causal inner product's ability to capture semantic structure and orthogonality, and confirm its utility in both measurement (probing) and intervention (steering) tasks. The paper highlights the critical role of the inner product choice, showing its limitations compared to the Euclidean inner product for capturing semantic relationships.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis\" using counterfactual pairs, distinguishing between embedding (intervention) and unembedding (measurement) representations.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which enforces orthogonality between representations of causally separable concepts, unifying embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   This causal inner product is crucial for constructing meaningful linear probes and activation steering vectors, enabling model interpretation and control.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear representations, demonstrate the causal inner product's semantic properties (orthogonality of separable concepts), and show its effectiveness in probing and steering.\n*   The work highlights that the Euclidean inner product often fails to capture semantic relationships, unlike the derived causal inner product.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper provides a unified geometric framework to connect the subspace hypothesis of linear concept representation (e.g., word2vec analogies) with practical techniques like linear probing and activation steering. It formalizes \"linear representation\" using counterfactual pairs in both the input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces. The key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product\" that respects the causal independence of concepts, meaning causally separable concepts are represented orthogonally. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, showing that the embedding representation is essentially the unembedding representation transformed by this inner product. This unification allows for the construction of intervention (steering) vectors from unembedding representations. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these ideas, demonstrating that concepts are indeed linearly represented, that the estimated causal inner product aligns with semantic separability, and that these representations can be used for both probing (measurement) and steering (intervention). The paper highlights the critical role of the inner product choice, contrasting the proposed causal inner product with the Euclidean inner product.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   **Unified Geometric Framework:** Introduces a single geometric framework that formally links the subspace hypothesis of linear concept representation with linear probing and activation steering.\n*   **Causal Inner Product:** Defines a novel \"causal inner product\" that ensures causally separable concepts are represented orthogonally, unifying embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   **Formalization via Counterfactuals:** Formalizes linear representation using counterfactual pairs, connecting unembedding representations to measurement (probing) and embedding representations to intervention (steering).\n*   **Experimental Validation:** Empirically validates the framework using LLaMA-2, showing evidence for linear representations, the semantic properties of the causal inner product, and the utility of concept directions for probing and steering.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper proposes a single geometric framework to formally connect the subspace hypothesis of linear representation (e.g., word2vec analogies) with practical techniques like linear probing and activation steering in Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors formalize \"linear representation\" using counterfactual pairs, defining it in both the input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces. They demonstrate that the unembedding representation corresponds to measurement (linear probing), while the embedding representation links to intervention (activation steering). A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which respects the causal separability of concepts. This specific inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for a single geometric understanding of linear representations. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these theoretical connections, showing that the causal inner product aligns with semantic structure and enables effective probing and steering, outperforming the standard Euclidean inner product. The work provides a unified geometric perspective that clarifies how linear algebraic operations can interpret and control LLM behavior.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes linear representation using counterfactual pairs, linking the subspace notion to both measurement (via unembedding representations) and intervention (via embedding representations).\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which defines orthogonality between representations of causally separable concepts, unifying embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and demonstrate that the causal inner product captures semantic structure, enabling effective linear probing and activation steering.\n*   The causal inner product is shown to be superior to the Euclidean inner product for understanding LLM representations, particularly in capturing semantic relationships and enabling control.\n*   The proposed geometric framework provides a unified approach to understanding and leveraging linear representations for both interpreting and controlling LLM behavior.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper provides a geometric framework to formally connect the subspace hypothesis of linear representations (as seen in word2vec analogies) with practical interpretation and control techniques like linear probing and activation steering. It formalizes \"linear representation\" using counterfactual pairs in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces. The core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product\" that treats causally separable concepts as orthogonal. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for a single geometric interpretation. The paper demonstrates that: 1) unembedding representations correspond to measurement (linear probing), and embedding representations correspond to intervention (activation steering); 2) the causal inner product can be estimated and respects semantic structure, bridging these notions; and 3) experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these connections, showing the efficacy of the causal inner product over the Euclidean one for capturing semantic relationships and enabling controlled interventions.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis\" using counterfactual pairs, linking the subspace notion to both measurement (linear probing) and intervention (activation steering).\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which treats causally separable concepts as orthogonal, unifying embedding and unembedding representations into a single geometric framework.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate that this causal inner product effectively captures semantic structure and enables more meaningful linear probing and activation steering compared to the standard Euclidean inner product.\n*   The work provides a unified geometric perspective where concepts are represented as directions, and their relationships (separability, measurement, intervention) are governed by the geometry, particularly the choice of inner product.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper provides a geometric framework to formally connect the \"subspace hypothesis\" of linear representations (e.g., word2vec analogies) with practical techniques like linear probing and activation steering. The authors introduce two formalizations of linear representation using counterfactual pairs: one in the output (unembedding) space, linking to measurement (linear probing), and one in the input (embedding) space, linking to intervention (activation steering). A key contribution is the definition of a \"causal inner product,\" which respects the semantic structure of language by making causally separable concepts orthogonal. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for a single geometric perspective. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and demonstrate that the causal inner product correctly captures semantic relationships, outperforming the Euclidean inner product. This framework offers a unified understanding of how concepts are represented linearly and how this representation can be leveraged for both interpreting and controlling language model behavior.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes linear representation using counterfactual pairs in both embedding (input) and unembedding (output) spaces, linking them to intervention and measurement (linear probing), respectively.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which makes causally separable concepts orthogonal, providing a unified geometric framework for understanding linear representations.\n*   This causal inner product unifies embedding and unembedding representations and is shown to be crucial for interpreting and controlling model behavior, outperforming the standard Euclidean inner product in experiments with LLaMA-2.\n*   The work establishes that concept directions derived from the subspace hypothesis can serve as effective linear probes for measurement and as steering vectors for intervention.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper proposes a single geometric framework to formally connect the \"subspace hypothesis\" of high-level concept representation in LLMs with practical interpretation and control techniques like linear probing and activation steering. The authors formalize \"linear representation\" using counterfactual pairs in both the input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces. They demonstrate that these formalizations correspond to measurement (via linear probing) and intervention (via activation steering), respectively. A crucial contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" defined by the orthogonality of causally separable concepts. This specific inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, enabling the construction of probes and steering vectors from counterfactual pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear representations, the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic structure (showing better performance than the Euclidean inner product), and its utility in both predicting model behavior (probing) and controlling it (steering).\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes linear representation using counterfactual pairs, bridging the subspace hypothesis with measurement (linear probing) and intervention (activation steering).\n*   A novel \"causal inner product\" is introduced, defined by the orthogonality of causally separable concepts, which unifies embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate that the causal inner product effectively captures semantic structure and enables accurate probing and steering, outperforming the standard Euclidean inner product.\n*   The framework provides a unified geometric perspective, showing how linear probing relates to unembedding representations and activation steering to embedding representations, unified by the causal inner product.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper proposes a single geometric framework to formally connect the subspace hypothesis (e.g., word2vec analogies) with linear probing and activation steering in Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors formalize \"linear representation\" using counterfactual pairs, distinguishing between representations in the output (unembedding) space and input (embedding) space. They demonstrate that unembedding representations correspond to measurement (linear probing), while embedding representations correspond to intervention (activation steering). A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which respects the causal separability of concepts. This inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for geometric operations like projection and similarity to be semantically meaningful. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations, demonstrate the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic structure and enabling probing and steering, and highlight its superiority over the standard Euclidean inner product.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes \"linear representation\" using counterfactual pairs, linking subspace notions to measurement (linear probing) in the unembedding space and intervention (activation steering) in the embedding space.\n*   A novel \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which respects the semantic separability of concepts and unifies embedding and unembedding representations, enabling meaningful geometric operations.\n*   Experimental validation with LLaMA-2 demonstrates the existence of linear concept representations and shows that the causal inner product effectively captures semantic structure, outperforming the Euclidean inner product for probing and steering tasks.\n*   The framework provides a unified geometric perspective where causally separable concepts are orthogonal in the representation space under the causal inner product.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" which posits that high-level concepts are represented as linear directions within a model's representation space. It provides a unified geometric framework connecting three interpretations of linear representation: subspace (analogies like word2vec), measurement (linear probing), and intervention (activation steering). The core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which respects the semantic independence of concepts by making their representations orthogonal. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding spaces, enabling the construction of probes and steering vectors from counterfactual word pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations, demonstrate that the causal inner product effectively captures semantic structure by enforcing orthogonality between causally separable concepts, and show its superiority over the standard Euclidean inner product. The framework formally links the subspace hypothesis to linear probing via unembedding representations and to activation steering via embedding representations, offering a cohesive geometric perspective on LLM interpretability and control.\n\n2.

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" which posits that high-level concepts are represented as linear directions within a model's representation space. It provides a unified geometric framework connecting three interpretations of linear representation: subspace (analogies like word2vec), measurement (linear probing), and intervention (activation steering). The core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which respects the semantic independence of concepts by making their representations orthogonal. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding spaces, enabling the construction of probes and steering vectors from counterfactual word pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations, demonstrate that the causal inner product effectively captures semantic structure by enforcing orthogonality between causally separable concepts, and show its superiority over the standard Euclidean inner product. The framework formally links the subspace hypothesis to linear probing via unembedding representations and to activation steering via embedding representations, offering a cohesive geometric perspective on LLM interpretability and control.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes the linear representation hypothesis by defining concepts as linear directions in representation spaces, using counterfactual pairs.\n*   It introduces a \"causal inner product\" that makes causally separable concepts orthogonal, unifying embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   This unified framework bridges the subspace hypothesis (e.g., word2vec analogies) with practical techniques like linear probing (via unembedding representations) and activation steering (via embedding representations).\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the effectiveness of the causal inner product, showing it better captures semantic structure and outperforms the Euclidean inner product in relating concepts to probing and steering capabilities.",
