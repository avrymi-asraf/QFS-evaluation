SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to systematically identify and quantify overfitting in Large Language Models (LLMs) to specific benchmark datasets. The core methodology involves generating perturbed versions of benchmark prompts through parametric transformations that preserve semantic content but alter surface-level cues. By evaluating LLMs on both original and perturbed datasets and employing statistical tests like McNemar's, C-BOD reveals whether a model's performance is driven by memorized patterns rather than true language understanding. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 leading LLMs demonstrated that most models exhibit a performance degradation under these perturbations, with larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy showing greater sensitivity. C-BOD is presented as a dataset- and model-agnostic tool that can be integrated into training pipelines to promote more robust and generalizable LLMs, challenging the community to look beyond leaderboard scores.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD uses parametric transformations to create semantically equivalent but textually altered benchmark prompts to detect LLM overfitting.\n*   The framework evaluates LLMs on both original and perturbed datasets, using statistical tests (McNemar's) to determine if performance drops are significant indicators of overfitting.\n*   Experiments showed that many LLMs, particularly larger ones and those with high initial accuracy, suffer performance degradation on rephrased prompts, indicating reliance on surface cues.\n*   C-BOD is designed to be dataset- and model-agnostic, allowing for broad application and integration into LLM training pipelines for improved robustness.\n*   The findings challenge the reliance on standard benchmark scores, emphasizing the need for evaluation methods that prioritize generalization and resilience to prompt variations.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to assess the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) by detecting overfitting to benchmark-specific surface cues. The methodology involves generating perturbed versions of benchmark prompts using a generative model (DeepSeek 3), controlled by a distortion parameter µ, while preserving semantic content. These perturbed datasets are then used alongside the original to evaluate LLMs. The core finding is that many LLMs, particularly larger and higher-performing ones on standard benchmarks like MMLU, exhibit a significant performance drop (average of 2.15%) when presented with these semantically equivalent but rephrased prompts. This suggests a reliance on memorized patterns rather than true language understanding. The study reveals a positive correlation between a model's baseline accuracy and its sensitivity to prompt perturbations, indicating that high scores on public leaderboards can be misleading. Conversely, models with lower baseline accuracy or those in the Llama family showed less degradation, suggesting greater resilience. The framework is dataset-agnostic and can be integrated into training pipelines to promote more robust LLM development.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD uses a generative model (DeepSeek 3) to create semantically equivalent but textually perturbed evaluation datasets, controlled by a distortion parameter µ, to detect LLM overfitting.\n*   LLMs, especially larger and higher-accuracy models, often show a significant performance drop (average 2.15%) on these perturbed prompts, indicating reliance on surface cues.\n*   A positive correlation exists between an LLM's baseline accuracy on original benchmarks and its susceptibility to performance degradation under prompt perturbations.\n*   The distortion parameter µ allows for systematic control over the extent of textual modification, revealing how sensitive models are to rephrasing.\n*   Models with lower baseline accuracy and the Llama family demonstrated less performance degradation, suggesting greater robustness to prompt variations.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify whether Large Language Models (LLMs) overfit to specific prompt patterns in evaluation datasets, rather than demonstrating true language understanding. C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts using a parametric rephrasing tool (controlled by parameter µ) to create perturbed datasets. LLMs are then evaluated on both original and perturbed datasets. The framework utilizes McNemar's test to statistically assess performance differences, indicating overfitting if a significant drop is observed. The methodology addresses a gap in existing techniques by detecting overfitting to benchmark-specific artifacts, not just training data contamination. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs revealed an average accuracy drop of 2.15% under modest perturbations, with 20 models showing statistically significant declines. Key findings indicate a positive correlation between model size and performance difference, as well as between baseline accuracy and performance difference, suggesting larger and higher-performing models are more susceptible to overfitting. While effective for surface-level overfitting, C-BOD's integration into training pipelines can be computationally expensive, and it may not capture deeper forms of overfitting.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD uses a parametric generative model to create perturbed evaluation datasets by rephrasing prompts while preserving semantic content, controlled by a distortion parameter µ.\n*   The methodology addresses the gap in detecting overfitting to benchmark-specific surface cues, which existing methods like n-gram overlap or embedding similarity fail to capture.\n*   McNemar's test is employed to statistically validate performance drops between original and perturbed datasets, identifying significant differences as indicators of overfitting.\n*   LLMs showed an average accuracy drop of 2.15% on perturbed datasets, with larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy exhibiting a greater tendency to overfit.\n*   Integrating C-BOD's iterative rephrasing into training can be computationally costly, and the framework primarily detects surface-level overfitting.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to assess how heavily Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on specific prompt patterns within evaluation datasets, rather than true language understanding. The methodology involves systematically distorting benchmark prompts using a generative model (DeepSeek 3) with a parametric distortion operator (µ). This creates perturbed datasets that preserve semantic content but alter surface-level cues. By evaluating LLMs on both original and perturbed datasets and employing McNemar's test for statistical significance, C-BOD quantifies performance degradation. Results show a significant average accuracy drop of 2.15% across 26 leading LLMs, with larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy exhibiting greater sensitivity to these perturbations, indicating a tendency to overfit. C-BOD addresses a gap in existing techniques by detecting overfitting to benchmark-specific artifacts, not just training data contamination. While effective for surface-level overfitting, limitations include potential overlooks of deeper overfitting forms and high computational costs for integration into training pipelines.\n\n2.

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to systematically assess Large Language Model (LLM) overfitting to benchmark-specific surface cues. C-BOD generates perturbed versions of benchmark prompts using a generative model (DeepSeek 3) with a distortion parameter (µ) to alter phrasing while preserving semantic content. By evaluating LLMs on both original and perturbed datasets and applying McNemar's test for statistical significance, C-BOD quantifies performance degradation. Key findings reveal a positive correlation between model size and accuracy with performance degradation, indicating that larger and higher-performing models are more susceptible to overfitting. The study highlights that LLMs often rely on memorized patterns rather than true language understanding. C-BOD's dataset-agnostic nature and the potential to integrate perturbed datasets into training pipelines offer a path for developing more robust and generalizable LLMs, moving beyond superficial leaderboard scores.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD uses a generative model (DeepSeek 3) to create semantically preserved, yet textually distorted, evaluation prompts to detect LLM overfitting.\n*   McNemar's test is crucial for statistically validating performance differences between original and perturbed prompts, identifying genuine overfitting.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy exhibit greater performance degradation on rephrased prompts, suggesting a reliance on surface cues.\n*   The framework addresses the gap in existing techniques by detecting overfitting to benchmark-specific artifacts, not just training data contamination.\n*   While effective for surface-level overfitting, C-BOD's ability to capture deeper forms of overfitting and the computational cost of integration are noted limitations.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to detect LLM overfitting to benchmark-specific surface cues. The core methodology involves using a generative model (DeepSeek 3) to systematically perturb benchmark prompts, such as those in MMLU, by rephrasing them while preserving semantic content and labels. This is controlled by a distortion parameter µ. C-BOD then evaluates the LLM on both original and perturbed datasets and uses McNemar's test to statistically validate performance differences. The study found that a significant portion of leading LLMs exhibit performance degradation (average 2.15%) under these perturbations, indicating reliance on memorized patterns rather than true understanding. Importantly, larger models and models with higher baseline accuracy showed a greater tendency to overfit, suggesting that high benchmark scores can be misleading. The framework is dataset-agnostic and can inform iterative overfit mitigation strategies during training. However, C-BOD's detection is primarily limited to textual surface-level overfitting and faces computational costs for integration.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD uses a generative model to create semantically preserved, rephrased benchmark prompts to detect LLM overfitting.\n*   McNemar's test is employed to statistically validate performance drops on perturbed prompts, revealing significant overfitting in most tested LLMs.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to exhibit greater performance degradation, indicating a correlation between scale/performance and overfitting.\n*   The framework highlights that high benchmark scores may mask an overreliance on surface cues, urging a shift towards evaluating robustness and generalization.\n*   While effective for surface-level overfitting, C-BOD has limitations in capturing deeper forms of overfitting and incurs computational costs for integration.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify overreliance on surface-level cues in Large Language Models (LLMs). C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts using a parametric transformation, controlled by a distortion parameter µ, while preserving semantic content. This process generates perturbed evaluation datasets. By comparing LLM performance on original and perturbed datasets and employing McNemar's test for statistical significance, C-BOD exposes whether high benchmark scores are due to genuine understanding or memorized patterns. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs revealed an average performance degradation of 2.15% under modest perturbations, with 20 models showing statistically significant drops. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy exhibited greater performance differences, indicating a tendency to overfit. The framework, which uses DeepSeek 3 for prompt rephrasing, is dataset-agnostic and aims to promote more robust LLM evaluation beyond leaderboard scores.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD uses a parametric transformation to generate perturbed evaluation datasets by rephrasing prompts while preserving semantic meaning, with DeepSeek 3 used for this rephrasing.\n*   The methodology employs McNemar's test to statistically validate performance differences between original and perturbed datasets, identifying significant overfitting.\n*   Results showed an average accuracy drop of 2.15% across 26 LLMs, with larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy exhibiting greater performance degradation.\n*   The scope of C-BOD's detection is primarily focused on textual rephrasing and surface-level cues, potentially overlooking deeper forms of overfitting.\n*   The findings challenge current LLM evaluation practices, emphasizing the need to prioritize resilience and generalization over raw benchmark scores.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to assess LLM overfitting to benchmark-specific surface cues. C-BOD systematically distorts prompts using a parametric transformation (controlled by µ) while preserving semantic content. By evaluating LLMs on both original and perturbed datasets and employing McNemar's test for statistical validation, C-BOD quantifies performance degradation. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs revealed an average accuracy drop of 2.15%, with 20 models showing statistically significant differences. Key findings indicate that larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy are more susceptible to overfitting. The framework's generative approach, using DeepSeek 3 for prompt rephrasing, addresses a gap in existing techniques by detecting overfitting to canonical prompt formats, not just training data contamination. While C-BOD effectively uncovers surface-level overfitting, limitations include overlooking deeper forms and the computational cost of integrating rephrasing into training pipelines for mitigation. The study challenges the community to prioritize resilience and generalization over leaderboard scores.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD uses generative models (DeepSeek 3) to create parametrically transformed prompts (controlled by µ) to detect LLM overfitting to benchmark surface cues.\n*   The framework quantifies performance degradation and uses McNemar's test to confirm statistical significance, revealing an average 2.15% accuracy drop across 26 LLMs.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy are more prone to performance degradation under prompt perturbations, indicating greater reliance on surface patterns.\n*   C-BOD addresses a gap by detecting overfitting to prompt structure, which existing methods like n-gram overlap or embedding similarity miss.\n*   The findings advocate for a shift in LLM evaluation towards prioritizing robustness and generalization over superficial benchmark performance.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify if Large Language Models (LLMs) overfit to specific surface cues within benchmark datasets, rather than demonstrating true language understanding. C-BOD achieves this by systematically distorting benchmark prompts using a parametric transformation, controlled by a distortion parameter µ, while preserving semantic content. The framework then evaluates the LLM on both original and perturbed datasets, using McNemar's test to statistically assess performance differences. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 leading LLMs revealed an average performance degradation of 2.15% under modest perturbations, with 20 models showing statistically significant drops. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy exhibited greater performance differences, suggesting a reliance on fixed prompt patterns. This approach addresses a gap in existing techniques by quantifying dependence on prompt phrasing, aiming to promote more robust LLM evaluation and development. The generative model DeepSeek 3 was used for prompt transformation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD uses a parametric transformation with a distortion parameter µ to generate perturbed evaluation datasets, aiming to detect LLM overfitting to surface cues.\n*   DeepSeek 3 was used as the generative model to create these prompt perturbations, which preserve semantic meaning but alter phrasing.\n*   McNemar's test is employed to statistically validate performance differences between original and perturbed datasets, indicating significant overfitting.\n*   Results showed an average 2.15% accuracy drop across LLMs, with larger models and those with higher initial accuracy exhibiting greater degradation.\n*   C-BOD's detection is primarily focused on textual rephrasing and may overlook deeper forms of overfitting, and integrating its mitigation strategies can be computationally expensive.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify if Large Language Models (LLMs) overfit to specific surface cues within benchmark datasets, rather than demonstrating true language understanding. C-BOD achieves this by systematically distorting benchmark prompts using a parametric transformation, controlled by a distortion parameter µ, while preserving semantic content. The framework then evaluates the LLM on both original and perturbed datasets, using McNemar's test to statistically assess performance differences. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 leading LLMs revealed an average performance degradation of 2.15% under modest perturbations, with 20 models showing statistically significant drops. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy exhibited greater performance differences, suggesting a reliance on fixed prompt patterns. This approach addresses a gap in existing techniques by quantifying dependence on prompt phrasing, aiming to promote more robust LLM evaluation and development. The generative model DeepSeek 3 was used for prompt transformation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD uses a parametric transformation with a distortion parameter µ to generate perturbed evaluation datasets, aiming to detect LLM overfitting to surface cues.\n*   DeepSeek 3 was used as the generative model to create these prompt perturbations, which preserve semantic meaning but alter phrasing.\n*   McNemar's test is employed to statistically validate performance differences between original and perturbed datasets, indicating significant overfitting.\n*   Results showed an average 2.15% accuracy drop across LLMs, with larger models and those with higher initial accuracy exhibiting greater degradation.\n*   C-BOD's detection is primarily focused on textual rephrasing and may overlook deeper forms of overfitting, and integrating its mitigation strategies can be computationally expensive.",
