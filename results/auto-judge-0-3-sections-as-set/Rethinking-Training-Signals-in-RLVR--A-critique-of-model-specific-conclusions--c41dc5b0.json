      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research critically examines how reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can lead to significant performance gains in language models, particularly the Qwen model family, even when using spurious or incorrect reward signals. The study demonstrates that Qwen models can achieve substantial improvements on mathematical reasoning tasks (e.g., MATH-500) with rewards like random assignments, incorrect labels, or format adherence, sometimes rivaling gains from ground truth rewards. Crucially, these spurious rewards often fail to yield similar benefits for other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, highlighting a model-specific dependency. The paper hypothesizes that RLVR, especially with spurious signals, primarily surfaces and amplifies pre-existing reasoning capabilities within the model, such as \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for mathematical thought processes) in Qwen models. This suggests that RLVR's effectiveness might be less about teaching new skills and more about eliciting latent ones, making it easy to achieve performance gains on certain models with signals that are not genuinely informative. The authors caution that RLVR research conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models may not generalize, urging validation on diverse model architectures.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen models achieve significant performance gains in RLVR with spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format adherence), sometimes matching ground truth rewards.\n*   These spurious reward signals are largely ineffective or even detrimental on other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, indicating a strong model-specific dependency.\n*   The gains are attributed to RLVR surfacing and amplifying pre-existing reasoning strategies within Qwen models, such as \"code reasoning,\" rather than learning new capabilities.\n*   The study cautions against drawing general conclusions from RLVR research focused solely on Qwen models, recommending validation across diverse model architectures.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is tied to whether the model's dominant pre-existing behaviors (like Qwen's code reasoning) correlate with correctness.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research critically examines the conclusions drawn in Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) studies, particularly highlighting how easily performance gains can be achieved using spurious reward signals. The study uses the Qwen model family as a case study, demonstrating that Qwen models, especially Qwen2.5-Math, exhibit substantial accuracy improvements on mathematical reasoning tasks (MATH-500, AMC) even when trained with rewards that are random, incorrect, or based on superficial formatting. These gains often rival those achieved with ground-truth rewards. Crucially, this phenomenon is model-specific: similar spurious rewards fail to yield improvements, and sometimes even degrade performance, on other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2. This divergence suggests that RLVR primarily surfaces or amplifies pre-existing, latent reasoning capabilities within a model. For Qwen2.5-Math, a key observed capability is \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for mathematical thought processes), which is significantly up-weighted by RLVR, even with spurious rewards. The paper warns that conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models may be misleading due to this sensitivity to spurious signals and lack of generalization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, achieve significant performance gains in RLVR with spurious reward signals (random, incorrect, format-based), often matching or nearly matching ground truth rewards.\n*   These performance gains are not generalizable; spurious rewards fail to improve or even degrade performance on other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, indicating model-specific sensitivities.\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards appears to elicit and amplify pre-existing reasoning strategies within models, such as \"code reasoning\" in Qwen2.5-Math, which strongly correlates with improved accuracy.\n*   The research warns against drawing broad conclusions from RLVR studies that rely heavily on Qwen models, as their susceptibility to spurious signals can create a false impression of generalizable improvements.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse model families to avoid misleading conclusions driven by model-specific spurious signal efficacy.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research critically examines the common practice of drawing conclusions from Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) research using specific models, highlighting the Qwen model family as a case study. The authors demonstrate that RLVR can achieve substantial performance gains, even with completely spurious or weak reward signals (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, format-based rewards), on Qwen models. These gains are often comparable to those achieved with ground truth rewards. Crucially, this phenomenon is highly model-specific; similar spurious rewards fail to yield significant improvements or even degrade performance on other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2. The study hypothesizes that RLVR, particularly with spurious signals, primarily elicits latent reasoning capabilities already present in the pre-trained model. For Qwen2.5-Math models, this often manifests as increased \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid in mathematical thinking), which strongly correlates with improved accuracy. The paper warns that relying solely on Qwen models for RLVR research can lead to misleading conclusions, as the observed performance boosts might be artifacts of the model's specific pre-training and not generalizable capabilities of RLVR itself. Future RLVR research is advised to be validated on a diverse range of models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve substantial performance gains on Qwen models even with spurious reward signals (random, incorrect labels, format-based), often rivaling ground truth reward performance.\n*   These spurious reward effects are highly model-specific, failing to generalize to other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, suggesting pre-training differences are key.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong propensity for \"code reasoning\" (using Python for math), which RLVR with spurious rewards significantly amplifies, leading to performance improvements.\n*   The research warns against drawing broad conclusions from RLVR studies solely based on Qwen models, as these gains may stem from eliciting latent capabilities rather than general RLVR effectiveness.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated across a diverse set of models to ensure generalizability and avoid misleading conclusions driven by model-specific sensitivities.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the efficacy of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its susceptibility to spurious reward signals, using the Qwen model family as a case study. The research demonstrates that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models even with rewards that are random, incorrect, or merely formatted, achieving performance gains comparable to ground truth rewards. Crucially, these spurious rewards fail to yield similar improvements in other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, highlighting the model-specific nature of RLVR's effectiveness. A key finding is that Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capability (generating Python code for problem-solving) that RLVR, even with spurious signals, readily amplifies. This amplification of latent abilities, rather than learning new skills, is hypothesized to be the mechanism behind the observed gains. The paper strongly warns that conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models may be misleading, urging future RLVR research to be validated across diverse model architectures to avoid spurious correlations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards (random, incorrect, format) significantly boosts Qwen2.5-Math model performance, often matching gains from ground truth rewards.\n*   These spurious reward benefits are largely absent in other model families (Llama3, OLMo2), indicating model-specific sensitivity.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models possess a strong pre-existing \"code reasoning\" ability that RLVR, even with spurious signals, effectively amplifies, driving performance gains.\n*   The research cautions against model-specific conclusions in RLVR, advocating for cross-model validation to avoid misleading results due to spurious signals.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and highlights a critical issue: model-specific conclusions in RL research. Using the Qwen model family as a case study, the paper demonstrates that Qwen models can achieve significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning tasks even with entirely spurious or incorrect reward signals. For instance, Qwen2.5-Math-7B saw substantial improvements with random, format, or incorrect label rewards, rivaling gains from ground-truth rewards. This efficacy of spurious rewards is largely attributed to Qwen models' pre-existing tendency towards \"code reasoning\" – generating Python code to aid mathematical problem-solving, even without execution. This behavior, when amplified by RLVR (even with flawed rewards), strongly correlates with improved accuracy. Crucially, these spurious reward strategies fail to generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, suggesting that RLVR's success is heavily dependent on the base model's pre-trained capabilities. The paper warns that drawing conclusions solely from Qwen models can be misleading, urging future RLVR research to be validated across diverse model architectures.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen models (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-7B) achieve significant performance gains in RLVR with spurious rewards (random, incorrect labels, format) that are comparable to ground-truth rewards.\n*   These gains in Qwen models are strongly linked to their pre-existing \"code reasoning\" behavior (generating Python code for math problems), which RLVR amplifies.\n*   Spurious reward strategies that work for Qwen models generally fail to provide similar improvements for other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, indicating a lack of generalizability.\n*   The research cautions that conclusions drawn from Qwen-centric RLVR studies may not apply broadly, emphasizing the need for validation across diverse model architectures.\n*   Interventions that explicitly encourage code reasoning (e.g., prompting or specific rewards) demonstrate a causal link to performance improvements in Qwen models, further supporting the hypothesis that RLVR elicits pre-existing capabilities.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research critically examines the efficacy of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and highlights a significant issue: model-specific conclusions in RLVR research, using the Qwen model family as a case study. The study reveals that RLVR can elicit substantial performance gains on Qwen models, even with entirely spurious or weak reward signals (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, format rewards). These gains can approach those achieved with ground truth rewards, demonstrating how easily performance improvements can be achieved through spurious signals that exploit pre-existing model behaviors rather than teaching new reasoning capabilities.\n\nCrucially, these spurious rewards do not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, which show minimal or even degraded performance. This divergence is attributed to Qwen models' strong pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capability—generating Python code for mathematical problem-solving without actual execution. RLVR, particularly with spurious rewards, appears to amplify this specific pre-trained behavior, leading to observed performance gains. The paper warns that conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models may be misleading and urges validation on diverse model architectures for future RLVR research.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve significant performance gains on Qwen models using spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format rewards), sometimes matching ground truth reward performance.\n*   These spurious reward-driven gains are highly model-specific; they fail to generalize to other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2.\n*   Qwen models exhibit a strong pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capability (generating Python for math), which RLVR, especially with spurious rewards, amplifies, leading to performance improvements.\n*   The research cautions that RLVR conclusions drawn from Qwen models may not be representative and advocates for validation across diverse model architectures.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research critically examines the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) when applied to language models, particularly highlighting how model-specific conclusions can be misleading. Using the Qwen model family as a case study, the paper demonstrates that Qwen models can achieve substantial performance gains on mathematical reasoning tasks (e.g., MATH-500) even with entirely spurious reward signals, such as random rewards, incorrect labels, or simply rewarding specific output formats. These gains, sometimes approaching those achieved with ground truth rewards, are significantly less pronounced or absent in other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2. The study posits that RLVR, especially with spurious rewards, primarily elicits latent reasoning capabilities already present in the pre-trained model. For Qwen2.5-Math models, a key pre-existing capability identified is \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for mathematical thought processes), which strongly correlates with improved accuracy. The paper emphasizes that RLVR's effectiveness with spurious signals is highly model-dependent, urging future research to validate findings across diverse model architectures rather than relying on a single, de facto choice like Qwen.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, show significant performance gains in mathematical reasoning with RLVR, even when using spurious rewards like random, format, or incorrect labels, achieving gains comparable to ground truth rewards.\n*   These spurious rewards yield minimal or negative performance improvements on other model families such as Llama3 and OLMo2, indicating a strong model-specific dependency of RLVR efficacy.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards on Qwen models is attributed to the elicitation of pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capabilities, where generating Python code for mathematical thought strongly correlates with higher accuracy.\n*   Experimental interventions confirm that directly inducing code reasoning (e.g., via prompting) improves Qwen model performance, while penalizing code reasoning reduces gains, causally linking this behavior to performance improvements.\n*   The paper warns that conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models in RLVR research may not generalize, and calls for validation on diverse models to avoid misleading results due to spurious signals.",

The study reveals that Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can significantly boost Qwen2.5-Math models' performance, even with \"spurious\" reward signals like random rewards or incorrect labels. These spurious rewards achieved performance gains comparable to ground truth rewards, demonstrating that RLVR can exploit latent capabilities rather than teaching new ones. Critically, these gains were not observed in other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, highlighting a lack of generalization. The paper identifies \"code reasoning\" — the generation of Python code to assist in mathematical problem-solving — as a pre-existing behavior in Qwen2.5-Math models that is effectively amplified by RLVR, even with weak signals. This causal link was further explored through interventions that explicitly encouraged code reasoning, leading to performance improvements in Qwen models but degradation in others. The findings strongly suggest that RLVR research should be validated on diverse models due to the model-specific nature of performance gains, especially when using spurious rewards.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve substantial performance gains on Qwen2.5-Math models even with entirely spurious reward signals (e.g., random or incorrect labels), often approaching the performance of ground truth rewards.\n*   These gains from spurious rewards are highly model-specific, failing to generalize to other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, suggesting that pre-training differences play a crucial role.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong pre-existing tendency for \"code reasoning\" (using Python for mathematical problem-solving), which RLVR effectively amplifies, leading to increased accuracy.\n*   Interventions that explicitly promote code reasoning confirm its causal link to performance improvements in Qwen models, while negatively impacting other models.\n*   The research warns against drawing broad conclusions from Qwen-centric RLVR studies, emphasizing the need for validation across diverse model architectures and pre-training distributions.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research critically examines the susceptibility of model-specific conclusions in Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to spurious signals, using the Qwen model family as a case study. The study reveals that RLVR, even with entirely random or incorrect reward signals, can achieve substantial performance gains (e.g., over 20% absolute accuracy improvement on MATH-500) on Qwen2.5-Math models. This effect is attributed to RLVR’s ability to elicit latent reasoning capabilities, particularly \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for mathematical problem-solving), which Qwen models exhibit prominently and correlates with higher accuracy. Crucially, these spurious rewards do not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, highlighting a significant model-specific bias. The paper warns that relying solely on Qwen models for RLVR research can lead to misleading conclusions due to their unique pre-training that fosters these elicitable reasoning patterns. The authors advocate for broader model validation in future RLVR research to avoid spurious correlations and ensure generalizable findings.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve significant performance gains (e.g., >20% absolute accuracy) on Qwen2.5-Math models using spurious rewards like random or incorrect labels.\n*   These performance gains are largely driven by RLVR's ability to elicit \"code reasoning,\" a pre-existing behavior in Qwen models that strongly correlates with improved accuracy.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-specific; they fail to yield similar gains on other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2.\n*   The research warns against drawing general conclusions from RLVR studies solely based on Qwen models, as their unique pre-training data can lead to spurious correlations between rewards and performance.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated across diverse model architectures to ensure findings are not model-specific artifacts.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and uncovers a critical issue: model-specific conclusions in RLVR research. Using the Qwen model family as a case study, the paper demonstrates how easily performance gains can be achieved with spurious reward signals (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format-based rewards), often rivaling gains from ground truth rewards. These spurious signals, however, fail to generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, highlighting a dependency on pre-existing model capabilities. The study identifies \"code reasoning\" – generating Python code for mathematical problem-solving without execution – as a distinctive behavior in Qwen models that is significantly amplified by RLVR, even with spurious rewards. This amplification of pre-existing, beneficial reasoning strategies is proposed as the mechanism behind these surprising gains. The work strongly warns against relying on single model families for RLVR conclusions and advocates for validation across diverse models to avoid misleading results due to model-specific biases.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve significant performance gains on Qwen models using spurious reward signals (random, incorrect labels, format) that are often comparable to ground truth rewards.\n*   These spurious reward-driven gains are highly model-specific and do not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, indicating a reliance on pre-existing model capabilities.\n*   Qwen models exhibit \"code reasoning\" (using Python for math without execution), a behavior that RLVR, even with spurious signals, significantly amplifies, leading to performance improvements.\n*   The research warns that conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models in RLVR research may be misleading due to these model-specific biases and the easy elicitation of spurious performance gains.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse models to ensure generalizability and avoid over-reliance on spurious signals.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research critiques the common practice of drawing conclusions from Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) solely on Qwen models. Using the Qwen model family as a case study, the paper demonstrates that RLVR can achieve substantial performance gains on these models even with entirely spurious reward signals (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, or format-based rewards). These gains often rival those achieved with ground truth rewards, significantly improving accuracy on benchmarks like MATH-500. Crucially, these spurious rewards fail to yield similar improvements on other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, highlighting a strong model-specific bias. The study posits that RLVR, particularly with spurious rewards, primarily elicits and upweights pre-existing reasoning strategies within the model. For Qwen2.5-Math, this often manifests as increased \"code reasoning\"—generating Python code to aid problem-solving, even without actual execution—which strongly correlates with improved accuracy. The paper warns that without validation across diverse models, RLVR research may overstate the efficacy of training signals and misattribute gains to the RL process itself rather than emergent model capabilities.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can produce significant performance gains on Qwen models using entirely spurious reward signals (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format rewards), often matching ground truth reward performance.\n*   These spurious reward effects are highly model-specific, failing to generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, indicating Qwen models have unique priors that RLVR can exploit.\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards appears to upweight pre-existing reasoning strategies, particularly \"code reasoning\" in Qwen2.5-Math models, which strongly correlates with accuracy improvements.\n*   The research warns that drawing conclusions from RLVR solely on Qwen models is misleading, as gains may stem from exploiting model-specific biases rather than the reward signal's true informativeness, emphasizing the need for cross-model validation.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research critically examines the conclusions drawn in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) studies, particularly when using the Qwen model family as a benchmark. The study demonstrates that Qwen models, specifically Qwen2.5-Math, achieve significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning tasks (e.g., MATH-500) even when trained with entirely spurious or weak reward signals like random rewards, incorrect labels, or format-based rewards. These gains are surprisingly comparable to those achieved with ground truth rewards. Crucially, these spurious rewards fail to yield similar improvements, and sometimes even degrade performance, on other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2. This divergence suggests that the observed performance improvements in Qwen models are not due to the reward signal itself teaching new reasoning capabilities, but rather due to RLVR eliciting pre-existing, often latent, reasoning strategies. The paper identifies \"code reasoning\"—the generation of Python code to aid in mathematical problem-solving—as a key pre-existing behavior in Qwen models that is amplified by RLVR, even with spurious signals. The authors warn that the strong performance of Qwen models with spurious rewards could lead to misleading conclusions in RLVR research, emphasizing the need to validate findings across diverse model architectures.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen models (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math) exhibit substantial performance gains in mathematical reasoning via RLVR even with spurious rewards (random, incorrect labels, format), matching gains from ground truth rewards.\n*   These spurious rewards are largely ineffective on other model families (Llama3, OLMo2), highlighting the model-specific nature of RLVR efficacy.\n*   Qwen models' gains are attributed to RLVR eliciting pre-existing reasoning strategies, particularly \"code reasoning,\" which correlates with higher accuracy.\n*   The study warns that conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models in RLVR research may be misleading due to their susceptibility to spurious signals.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse model families to avoid drawing conclusions based on model-specific biases.",

The paper demonstrates that RLVR can achieve significant performance gains on Qwen models, even with entirely spurious or weak reward signals (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, format adherence). These gains, sometimes approaching those from ground-truth rewards, are attributed to RLVR's ability to elicit pre-existing reasoning strategies within the model. Notably, Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong propensity for \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for mathematical problem-solving without execution), which is highly correlated with accuracy. RLVR effectively amplifies this behavior, leading to substantial improvements. Crucially, these spurious reward effects do not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, which either show minimal gains or degrade in performance. This model-specific sensitivity underscores the danger of drawing broad conclusions from single model families and emphasizes the need for cross-model validation in RLVR research. The paper warns that current RLVR research, often focused on Qwen models, may be overstating the impact of specific reward signals due to these model-specific biases.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n* RLVR can achieve substantial performance gains on Qwen models using weak or spurious reward signals (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format adherence), often comparable to ground-truth rewards.\n* These gains in Qwen models are largely driven by RLVR's ability to elicit and amplify pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capabilities, which correlate strongly with accuracy.\n* The observed effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-specific; these methods fail to generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, highlighting model biases in RLVR research.\n* The study warns that conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models in RLVR research may be misleading due to these model-specific sensitivities and the ease of achieving gains with spurious signals.\n* Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse model families to avoid overstating the impact of specific reward signals and to understand true generalization.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research critically examines the conclusions drawn from Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) studies, particularly highlighting how model-specific performance gains can be easily achieved with spurious reward signals. Using the Qwen model family as a case study, the paper demonstrates that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning even with rewards that are random, incorrect, or merely based on output formatting. For instance, Qwen2.5-Math-7B achieved substantial accuracy gains on the MATH-500 benchmark with spurious rewards, sometimes approaching improvements seen with ground truth rewards. Crucially, these same spurious rewards failed to yield similar gains or even degraded performance on other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2. This divergence suggests that RLVR often amplifies pre-existing, model-specific reasoning strategies, such as Qwen2.5-Math's propensity for \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for mathematical thought processes). The study strongly advocates for validating RLVR research across diverse model architectures to avoid drawing misleading conclusions based on the specific behaviors of models like Qwen.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve significant performance gains with spurious reward signals (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format) on Qwen models, often comparable to ground truth rewards.\n*   These spurious rewards are largely ineffective and can even degrade performance on other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, indicating a strong model-specific bias.\n*   Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, exhibit a pre-existing \"code reasoning\" behavior that RLVR amplifies, leading to performance improvements.\n*   The study emphasizes that RLVR often elicits latent capabilities learned during pretraining rather than teaching new reasoning skills.\n*   A critical warning is issued for future RLVR research to validate findings across diverse models, not just Qwen, to avoid spurious conclusions.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research critiques the tendency in Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to draw conclusions from model-specific results, using the Qwen model family as a case study. The paper demonstrates that RLVR can achieve substantial performance gains on Qwen models, even with entirely spurious reward signals (e.g., random, incorrect labels, or format-based rewards). These gains, particularly on the MATH-500 benchmark, can rival those achieved with ground truth rewards, with absolute accuracy improvements of up to 29.1% using ground truth and over 20% with spurious rewards. Crucially, these spurious rewards often fail to provide similar benefits or even degrade performance on other model families like Llama and OLMo. The study identifies \"code reasoning\"—generating Python code to aid mathematical problem-solving without actual execution—as a key pre-existing capability in Qwen2.5-Math models that RLVR effectively upweights. This amplification of latent abilities, rather than learning new skills, is hypothesized to be the mechanism behind the gains, explaining the model specificity. The findings strongly suggest that future RLVR research should be validated on diverse model architectures to avoid drawing potentially misleading, model-specific conclusions.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards (random, incorrect labels, format) yields significant performance gains on Qwen models, comparable to ground truth rewards, highlighting a potential for model-specific biases in research.\n*   These spurious rewards largely fail to generalize to other model families like Llama and OLMo, indicating that observed gains are often tied to pre-existing, model-specific capabilities.\n*   The Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong pre-existing \"code reasoning\" behavior (using Python for problem-solving), which RLVR effectively amplifies, leading to performance improvements.\n*   The study emphasizes the need for cross-model validation in RLVR research to ensure findings are generalizable and not artifacts of specific model architectures or pre-training.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious signals is attributed to the algorithm upweighting existing, beneficial reasoning strategies rather than teaching new ones, making model pre-training a critical factor.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research critiques the tendency in Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to draw conclusions from model-specific results, using the Qwen model family as a case study. The paper demonstrates that RLVR can achieve substantial performance gains on Qwen models, even with entirely spurious reward signals (e.g., random, incorrect labels, or format-based rewards). These gains, particularly on the MATH-500 benchmark, can rival those achieved with ground truth rewards, with absolute accuracy improvements of up to 29.1% using ground truth and over 20% with spurious rewards. Crucially, these spurious rewards often fail to provide similar benefits or even degrade performance on other model families like Llama and OLMo. The study identifies \"code reasoning\"—generating Python code to aid mathematical problem-solving without actual execution—as a key pre-existing capability in Qwen2.5-Math models that RLVR effectively upweights. This amplification of latent abilities, rather than learning new skills, is hypothesized to be the mechanism behind the gains, explaining the model specificity. The findings strongly suggest that future RLVR research should be validated on diverse model architectures to avoid drawing potentially misleading, model-specific conclusions.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards (random, incorrect labels, format) yields significant performance gains on Qwen models, comparable to ground truth rewards, highlighting a potential for model-specific biases in research.\n*   These spurious rewards largely fail to generalize to other model families like Llama and OLMo, indicating that observed gains are often tied to pre-existing, model-specific capabilities.\n*   The Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong pre-existing \"code reasoning\" behavior (using Python for problem-solving), which RLVR effectively amplifies, leading to performance improvements.\n*   The study emphasizes the need for cross-model validation in RLVR research to ensure findings are generalizable and not artifacts of specific model architectures or pre-training.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious signals is attributed to the algorithm upweighting existing, beneficial reasoning strategies rather than teaching new ones, making model pre-training a critical factor.",
