SUMMARY:\nThis survey explores the integration of multi-objective evolutionary principles within research combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). The application of multi-objective optimization is evident in several key areas. Firstly, in LLM-enhanced EA, multi-objective approaches are used for prompt engineering, aiming to optimize prompts based on multiple criteria like performance and instruction length. Secondly, in EA-enhanced LLM, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are employed for Neural Architecture Search (NAS), balancing objectives such as model performance and latency. The paper also highlights applications where the synergy of LLMs and EAs drives advancements, such as optimizing software project planning with multiple objectives (e.g., error, confidence interval, number of examples). The research indicates a growing trend of leveraging multi-objective principles to navigate complex search spaces and achieve more balanced and effective solutions when combining LLMs and EAs across various domains.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Multi-objective evolutionary principles are applied in prompt engineering for LLMs, optimizing prompts based on multiple criteria.\n*   Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for LLMs frequently utilizes multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to balance performance and efficiency metrics.\n*   Applications like software project planning demonstrate the integration of multi-objective optimization to manage trade-offs between various goals when combining LLMs and EAs.\n*   The trend shows an increasing use of multi-objective approaches to manage complex search spaces and achieve better-balanced outcomes in LLM-EA collaborations.",

SUMMARY:\nThe application of multi-objective evolutionary principles is a significant theme in the research exploring the synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). In the context of EA-enhanced LLMs, multi-objective Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is employed to balance various metrics, such as performance and latency, as seen in methods like LiteTransformerSearch and Klein et al.'s work. Prompt engineering also benefits from multi-objective optimization, with EMO-Prompts specifically addressing the generation of prompts that evoke multiple emotions. The InstOptima method utilizes NSGA-II for multi-objective prompt optimization. Furthermore, LLM-enhanced EAs leverage multi-objective prompt engineering, where objectives beyond simple performance are considered. In the realm of applications, multi-objective optimization is applied to software project planning, as demonstrated by SBSE, which uses NSGA-II to optimize example selection for story point estimation. The QDAIF algorithm plays a role in multi-objective optimization by using LLMs to evaluate solution quality and diversity. MO-MFEA is highlighted as a multi-objective model relevant to LLM applications.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThe surveyed research extensively details the application of multi-objective evolutionary principles across various intersections of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). In LLM-enhanced EA, multi-objective optimization is applied to prompt engineering, as seen with InstOptima using NSGA-II to balance multiple objectives for prompt optimization. EMO-Prompts also exemplifies this by optimizing prompts for multiple emotional targets. Within EA-enhanced LLM, multi-objective Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a key area, with methods like SuperShaper aiming to balance metrics like perplexity and latency. Table IV further lists EA-based NAS methods, many of which are inherently multi-objective. Applications driven by the integrated synergy of LLM and EA also leverage multi-objective approaches, as indicated in Table V, for tasks like software project planning where NSGA-II optimizes story point estimation based on multiple criteria. Furthermore, the Quality-Diversity (QD) through AI Feedback (QDAIF) algorithm utilizes LLMs within a multi-objective framework for quality and diversity evaluation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Multi-objective optimization is a significant application of evolutionary principles in the synergy between LLMs and EAs, particularly in prompt engineering and Neural Architecture Search (NAS).\n*   Methods like InstOptima and EMO-Prompts demonstrate multi-objective prompt engineering, using algorithms like NSGA-II to balance various objectives.\n*   In NAS, multi-objective approaches are employed by methods such as SuperShaper to concurrently optimize different performance metrics, with Table IV cataloging several EA-based multi-objective NAS techniques.\n*   Applications driven by LLM and EA integration, detailed in Table V, frequently utilize multi-objective optimization, exemplified by software project planning tasks.\n*   The QDAIF algorithm integrates LLMs within a multi-objective framework to enhance quality and diversity in evolutionary optimization.",

From the perspective of multi-objective evolutionary principles, the research highlights several key areas. In LLM-assisted EA, multi-objective aspects are addressed in both black-box optimization (e.g., Quality-Diversity through AI Feedback - QDAIF) and prompt engineering (e.g., InstOptima balancing objectives, EMO-Prompts for emotional text generation). For EA-enhanced LLM, multi-objective Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a significant focus, with methods like SuperShaper and those in Table IV employing multi-objective EAs (e.g., MOEA, MO-MFEA) to balance metrics like perplexity, latency, and model size for specialized models. Theoretical studies are also proposed for algorithm analysis, including convergence and complexity. The paper also details Evol-Instruct for data augmentation and SBSE for multi-objective optimization in software project planning. Overall, multi-objective evolutionary principles are applied to enhance both LLMs and EAs, leading to more sophisticated applications.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Multi-objective evolutionary principles are applied across various LLM-EA interactions, including optimizing prompts (InstOptima, EMO-Prompts) and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to balance multiple performance metrics.\n*   Table I and IV showcase specific LLM-assisted EA and EA-enhanced LLM methods respectively, with a notable presence of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) like NSGA-II, MO-MFEA, and CMA-ES for complex optimization and NAS tasks.\n*   Future research directions include theoretical analysis of LLM+EA methods, focusing on algorithm convergence and complexity, and practical applications like multi-objective software project planning (SBSE) and data augmentation (Evol-Instruct).",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThe surveyed research extensively details the application of multi-objective evolutionary principles in the synergistic interplay between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). In LLM-enhanced EA, multi-objective optimization is applied to prompt engineering, with methods like InstOptima using NSGA-II to balance objectives such as instruction length and performance, and EMO-Prompts optimizing for multiple emotional outputs. The QDAIF algorithm plays a role in multi-objective optimization by using LLMs for quality and diversity evaluation. For EA-enhanced LLMs, multi-objective Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a key area, as seen in LiteTransformerSearch, which optimizes perplexity and latency. Table IV highlights MOEA methods used in NAS, and SuperShaper specifically addresses multi-objective NAS by balancing perplexity and latency. MO-MFEA is also used for multi-objective, multi-task learning to create specialized LLM models. Theoretically, algorithm analysis within LLM+EA methods focuses on convergence, complexity, and applicability. In software project planning, multi-objective optimization (e.g., using NSGA-II) is used for story point estimation, balancing accuracy and complexity.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Multi-objective evolutionary principles are applied in both LLM-enhanced EA (e.g., prompt engineering with InstOptima and EMO-Prompts) and EA-enhanced LLM (e.g., multi-objective NAS with LiteTransformerSearch and SuperShaper).\n*   Methods like InstOptima and EMO-Prompts utilize specific multi-objective EAs like NSGA-II to balance various objectives in prompt optimization.\n*   Multi-objective NAS is a significant application where EAs, including MOEA methods detailed in Table IV, are employed to optimize multiple metrics like perplexity and latency for LLM architectures.\n*   Theoretical studies for LLM+EA methods aim to analyze algorithm convergence, complexity, and applicability, providing a deeper understanding of their interactions.\n*   Applications like software project planning utilize multi-objective optimization (e.g., NSGA-II) to balance conflicting goals such as estimation accuracy and complexity.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThe surveyed research extensively details the application of multi-objective evolutionary principles in the synergistic interplay between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). In LLM-enhanced EA, multi-objective optimization is applied to prompt engineering, with methods like InstOptima using NSGA-II to balance objectives such as instruction length and performance, and EMO-Prompts optimizing for multiple emotional outputs. The QDAIF algorithm plays a role in multi-objective optimization by using LLMs for quality and diversity evaluation. For EA-enhanced LLMs, multi-objective Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a key area, as seen in LiteTransformerSearch, which optimizes perplexity and latency. Table IV highlights MOEA methods used in NAS, and SuperShaper specifically addresses multi-objective NAS by balancing perplexity and latency. MO-MFEA is also used for multi-objective, multi-task learning to create specialized LLM models. Theoretically, algorithm analysis within LLM+EA methods focuses on convergence, complexity, and applicability. In software project planning, multi-objective optimization (e.g., using NSGA-II) is used for story point estimation, balancing accuracy and complexity.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Multi-objective evolutionary principles are applied in both LLM-enhanced EA (e.g., prompt engineering with InstOptima and EMO-Prompts) and EA-enhanced LLM (e.g., multi-objective NAS with LiteTransformerSearch and SuperShaper).\n*   Methods like InstOptima and EMO-Prompts utilize specific multi-objective EAs like NSGA-II to balance various objectives in prompt optimization.\n*   Multi-objective NAS is a significant application where EAs, including MOEA methods detailed in Table IV, are employed to optimize multiple metrics like perplexity and latency for LLM architectures.\n*   Theoretical studies for LLM+EA methods aim to analyze algorithm convergence, complexity, and applicability, providing a deeper understanding of their interactions.\n*   Applications like software project planning utilize multi-objective optimization (e.g., NSGA-II) to balance conflicting goals such as estimation accuracy and complexity.",
