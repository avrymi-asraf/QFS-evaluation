The authors observe that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs captures most of the task-specific information. This insight leads to TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a compression method that reduces task vectors by 90% while retaining 99% accuracy. More importantly for the user's query, they leverage the TSVs to reduce task interference. By decorrelating TSVs from different tasks through an orthogonalization process (specifically, solving an orthogonal Procrustes problem), they develop TSV-Merge (TSV-M). This method combines compression with interference reduction, significantly outperforming existing model merging techniques by an average of 15% accuracy. The TSVs provide a geometrically informed basis for analyzing and mitigating task interference at the layer level.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) are extracted from the SVD of per-layer task matrices, revealing their low-rank nature.\n*   TSVs are used to define and reduce task interference by decorrelating singular vectors from different tasks via orthogonalization (Orthogonal Procrustes).\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines TSV-based compression with this interference reduction, achieving state-of-the-art performance in model merging.\n*   The approach provides a fine-grained understanding of inter-task interactions at the layer level, going beyond global similarity metrics.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices to address model merging challenges, particularly task interference. The authors demonstrate that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, allowing for significant compression (TSV-Compress, TSV-C) while retaining high accuracy. Crucially, they leverage the geometric properties of TSVs to measure and reduce task interference. Their proposed model merging method, TSV-Merge (TSV-M), combines this compression with a decorrelation step using an orthogonal Procrustes problem. This decorrelation aims to minimize interference by aligning singular vectors from different tasks. The effectiveness of TSV-M is validated through extensive experiments, showing substantial performance improvements over existing methods by effectively mitigating task interference. The paper also theoretically and empirically supports the idea that applying interference reduction to low-rank approximations incurs less approximation error than applying it to full-rank matrices.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) extracted via SVD reveal the low-rank nature of per-layer task matrices, enabling efficient compression (TSV-C).\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) decorrelates TSVs from different tasks using an orthogonal Procrustes problem to reduce inter-task interference.\n*   Decorrelating TSVs via Procrustes is mathematically equivalent to whitening and leads to lower approximation errors compared to applying it to full-rank matrices.\n*   TSV-M significantly outperforms existing model merging techniques by combining compression and interference reduction.",

These TSVs reveal that task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs can represent a task's function with high fidelity, enabling efficient compression (TSV-Compress). Crucially, the interaction between TSVs from different tasks is used to measure and mitigate task interference, a significant issue in model merging. The proposed TSV-Merge method combines this low-rank compression with a novel interference reduction technique. This reduction is achieved by decorrelating the TSVs using an orthogonal transformation, specifically formulated as an Orthogonal Procrustes problem to find the optimal orthogonal matrix that minimizes projection error. This approach significantly outperforms existing model merging techniques by effectively reducing task interference and improving overall performance.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Task matrices are low-rank, allowing for compression by retaining only the most significant Task Singular Vectors (TSVs).\n*   Task interference is measured by the interaction (overlap) of TSVs from different tasks.\n*   TSV-Merge reduces task interference by decorrelating TSVs using an Orthogonal Procrustes transformation, which finds an optimal orthogonal matrix to minimize projection error.\n*   The Orthogonal Procrustes problem for decorrelation is mathematically equivalent to a whitening transformation.\n*   Combining low-rank approximation with interference reduction via TSV-Merge significantly boosts model merging performance.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Task Singular Vectors (TSV) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices to address challenges in model merging, particularly task interference. The authors confirm that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs captures most of the task-specific information. This insight leads to TSV-Compress (TSV-C) for efficient compression. For model merging, TSV-Merge (TSV-M) leverages TSVs to reduce task interference. A key aspect of TSV-M is decorrelating TSVs from different tasks by applying a whitening transformation, which is reformulated as an Orthogonal Procrustes problem. This problem has a closed-form solution obtained via SVD. An ablation study demonstrates that while interference reduction is crucial, applying it to low-rank approximations (as in TSV-M) yields better results than applying it to full-rank matrices due to reduced approximation errors during orthogonalization, as supported by Theorem 6.1. The paper highlights that TSV-M significantly outperforms existing methods by combining compression and interference reduction.\n\n2.

Task matrices, representing weight differences for specific tasks, are shown to be inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs captures most of the task-specific information. This insight leads to TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a compression method that reduces task vectors to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% accuracy. Crucially for decorrelation, TSV-Merge (TSV-M) leverages TSVs to reduce inter-task interference. This is achieved by decorrelating the TSVs from different tasks using an orthogonalization process, specifically formulated as an Orthogonal Procrustes problem. This problem has a closed-form solution derived from the SVD of the concatenated TSVs, providing a method to create decorrelated bases. The paper demonstrates that combining low-rank approximation with this interference reduction through Procrustes orthonormalization significantly outperforms existing model merging techniques, leading to state-of-the-art results.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) are extracted from the SVD of per-layer task matrices, revealing their low-rank nature.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) decorrelates TSVs from different tasks using an Orthogonal Procrustes problem, which has a closed-form solution derived from SVD.\n*   This decorrelation process aims to minimize interference by ensuring task-specific singular vectors are orthogonal.\n*   The proposed approach, combining low-rank approximation with Procrustes-based interference reduction, achieves state-of-the-art performance in model merging.\n*   Ablation studies show that interference reduction on low-rank matrices is more effective than on full-rank matrices due to reduced approximation errors during orthogonalization.",

For model merging, TSV-Merge (TSV-M) utilizes these TSVs to reduce task interference. Specifically, to decorrelate task-specific feature bases, TSV-M employs a whitening transformation applied to the singular vectors. This whitening is achieved by solving an orthogonal Procrustes problem, which seeks an orthogonal matrix that minimizes the projection error. The paper demonstrates that this Procrustes formulation is equivalent to whitening and provides a closed-form solution via SVD. The study highlights that applying interference reduction to low-rank approximations results in lower approximation errors during orthogonalization compared to full-rank matrices, a finding supported by Theorem 6.1. Ultimately, TSV-M combines compression with this decorrelation strategy, significantly outperforming existing methods by reducing task interference.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Task Singular Vectors (TSV) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices to address task interference in model merging. The core idea is that these TSVs capture task-specific feature bases. The research proposes TSV-Compress (TSV-C) for efficient compression by retaining only the most significant TSVs, reducing task vectors to 10% of their original size while preserving 99% accuracy. To combat task interference, TSV-Merge (TSV-M) leverages the geometric interaction of TSVs from different tasks. This is achieved by decorrelating these singular vectors using an orthogonal transformation, specifically formulated as an Orthogonal Procrustes problem. This process aims to minimize the projection error of the TSVs, effectively reducing cross-task correlations and thereby mitigating interference. The paper demonstrates that this decorrelation, when applied to low-rank approximations of task matrices, leads to significant performance gains in model merging, outperforming existing methods.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) are derived from the SVD of per-layer task matrices, representing task-specific feature bases.\n*   Orthogonal Procrustes analysis is employed in TSV-Merge (TSV-M) to decorrelate TSVs from different tasks, thereby reducing task interference.\n*   Decorrelating TSVs via the Procrustes problem minimizes projection errors, leading to a more effective reduction of cross-task interactions.\n*   Combining low-rank approximation with TSV decorrelation through Procrustes analysis is shown to significantly improve model merging performance.",

The core idea is that these TSVs capture task-specific feature bases. The research proposes TSV-Compress (TSV-C) for efficient compression by retaining only the most significant TSVs, achieving a 10x reduction while preserving 99% accuracy. Crucially for the user's query, TSV-Merge (TSV-M) leverages these TSVs to decorrelate task-specific feature bases. This decorrelation is achieved by applying a whitening transformation, reformulated as an Orthogonal Procrustes problem, to the TSV matrices. By minimizing the interaction (correlation) between singular vectors of different tasks, TSV-M effectively reduces task interference. The paper demonstrates that this decorrelation, particularly when applied to low-rank approximations of task matrices, significantly improves model merging performance, outperforming existing methods by a substantial margin. Theorem 6.1 provides theoretical backing for why this approach, when applied to low-rank matrices, incurs less approximation error during orthogonalization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n* Orthogonal Procrustes analysis is employed to decorrelate Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) across different tasks, thereby reducing task interference in model merging.\n* TSVs are derived from the SVD of per-layer task matrices, representing task-specific feature bases.\n* TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines low-rank approximation of these TSVs with decorrelation via Procrustes to achieve state-of-the-art model merging performance.\n* Decorrelating TSVs through Procrustes (whitening) is shown to be crucial for minimizing interference and improving accuracy.\n* Theorem 6.1 suggests that applying Procrustes to low-rank TSVs results in less approximation error compared to full-rank matrices.",

The core idea is that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs captures most of the task-specific information. The authors propose TSV-Compress (TSV-C) to efficiently compress task vectors by retaining only the most significant TSVs, achieving substantial size reduction with minimal accuracy loss. Crucially, they leverage the geometric properties of TSVs to measure and reduce task interference. To decorrelate TSVs from different tasks and mitigate interference, they reformulate this as an Orthogonal Procrustes problem, finding an orthogonal matrix that minimizes projection error. This is solved via SVD, providing a closed-form solution. The paper demonstrates that combining this decorrelation (interference reduction) with low-rank approximation (compression) in TSV-Merge (TSV-M) significantly outperforms existing model merging methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Task-specific weight differences (task matrices) are analyzed using SVD, yielding Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) that reveal low-rank properties.\n*   Orthogonal Procrustes problem is employed to decorrelate TSVs from different tasks, thereby reducing task interference, with a closed-form solution derived via SVD.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines TSV compression (TSV-C) with this interference reduction method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in model merging.\n*   Ablation studies show that interference reduction is most effective when applied to low-rank approximations of task matrices, rather than full-rank ones.",

The core of their approach involves utilizing the low-rank nature of these task matrices. For compression, TSV-Compress (TSV-C) reduces task vector size significantly while maintaining high accuracy. For model merging, TSV-Merge (TSV-M) leverages TSVs to reduce task interference. A key step in TSV-M is decorrelating TSVs from different tasks. This decorrelation is achieved by reformulating a whitening transformation as an Orthogonal Procrustes problem. The paper provides a closed-form solution for this problem via SVD, ensuring that the singular vectors are made orthogonal. Theorem 6.1 provides theoretical backing, suggesting that applying this orthogonalization to low-rank approximations incurs less approximation error than to full-rank matrices.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Task Singular Vectors (TSV) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices to address task interference in model merging. The authors observe that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs captures most of the task-specific information. Based on this, they propose TSV-Compress (TSV-C) for efficient compression, reducing task vectors to 10% of their size while retaining 99% accuracy. Crucially, to mitigate task interference, TSV-Merge (TSV-M) decorrelates TSVs from different tasks. This decorrelation is achieved by reformulating a whitening transformation as an Orthogonal Procrustes problem, which seeks an orthogonal matrix to minimize projection error. The closed-form solution for this problem is derived via SVD. The paper argues that applying interference reduction to low-rank matrices yields better results than applying it to full-rank matrices due to lower approximation errors during orthogonalization, as supported by Theorem 6.1. TSV-M significantly outperforms existing methods by combining compression with this interference reduction strategy.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Task Singular Vectors (TSVs), derived from the SVD of per-layer task matrices, reveal the low-rank nature of these matrices.\n*   Orthogonal Procrustes analysis is employed to decorrelate TSVs from different tasks, a key step in the TSV-Merge (TSV-M) approach for reducing task interference.\n*   The decorrelation via Procrustes problem has a closed-form solution derived from SVD, offering an effective way to minimize cross-task interactions.\n*   Applying interference reduction to low-rank TSVs results in lower approximation errors during orthogonalization compared to full-rank matrices, leading to better overall performance.\n*   TSV-Merge effectively combines compression with interference reduction, achieving state-of-the-art performance in model merging.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper proposes TSV-Merge (TSV-M), a novel model merging technique that leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices to decorrelate task-specific feature bases, thereby reducing task interference. The core idea is to represent task-specific weight changes as Task Singular Vectors (TSVs). These TSVs are found to be inherently low-rank, allowing for efficient compression (TSV-Compress, TSV-C) while retaining high accuracy. For model merging, TSV-M decorrelates the TSVs from different tasks by applying a whitening transformation. This transformation is reformulated as an Orthogonal Procrustes problem, which has a closed-form solution derived from SVD. This decorrelation specifically targets and reduces inter-task interference, leading to significant performance improvements over existing methods. The paper also provides theoretical backing, including Theorem 6.1, which explains why applying interference reduction to low-rank matrices results in less approximation error during the orthogonalization process compared to full-rank matrices.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) decorrelates task-specific feature bases using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices.\n*   The decorrelation is achieved by applying a whitening transformation, reformulated as an Orthogonal Procrustes problem with a closed-form SVD-based solution.\n*   Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) are shown to be low-rank, enabling efficient compression (TSV-C) while preserving high accuracy.\n*   An ablation study demonstrates that interference reduction is most effective when applied to low-rank approximations of task matrices, as explained by Theorem 6.1 regarding reduced approximation error.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices to address model merging challenges, particularly task interference. The authors observe that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs captures most of the task-specific information. They propose TSV-Compress (TSV-C) to reduce task vector size by approximately 90% while retaining 99% accuracy, offering efficient storage. To combat task interference during model merging, TSV-Merge (TSV-M) leverages TSVs. It decorrelates TSVs from different tasks by applying a whitening transformation, which is reformulated as an Orthogonal Procrustes problem. The closed-form solution for this problem involves an SVD of the concatenated TSVs. This decorrelation step, combined with low-rank approximation, significantly outperforms existing methods by reducing interference. An ablation study confirms that interference reduction is crucial, especially when applied to low-rank representations, as orthogonalizing full-rank matrices introduces substantial approximation errors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Task matrices are observed to be low-rank, allowing compression by retaining only a subset of Task Singular Vectors (TSVs).\n*   Orthogonal Procrustes analysis is used to decorrelate TSVs from different tasks, effectively reducing task interference during model merging.\n*   The proposed TSV-Merge (TSV-M) method combines low-rank approximation with TSV decorrelation via Procrustes, achieving state-of-the-art performance.\n*   Applying interference reduction to low-rank matrices results in lower approximation errors compared to applying it to full-rank matrices.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices to address model merging challenges, particularly task interference. The authors demonstrate that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, allowing for effective compression (TSV-Compress) while retaining high accuracy. Crucially, they leverage the geometric properties of TSVs to measure and mitigate task interference. To decorrelate TSVs from different tasks and reduce interference, they propose TSV-Merge. This method reformulates the decorrelation as an Orthogonal Procrustes problem, seeking an orthogonal matrix to minimize projection error, which has a closed-form solution via SVD. This approach directly tackles task interference by ensuring singular vectors from different tasks are independent, leading to significant performance improvements in model merging compared to existing methods. The paper also theoretically and empirically shows that applying interference reduction to low-rank approximations results in lower approximation errors than applying it to full-rank matrices.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Orthogonal Procrustes analysis is used to decorrelate Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) from different tasks, thereby reducing task interference in model merging.\n*   Per-layer task matrices are shown to be low-rank, enabling compression (TSV-Compress) and providing a basis for analyzing task interference.\n*   TSV-Merge combines low-rank approximation with TSV decorrelation via the Orthogonal Procrustes problem to achieve state-of-the-art model merging performance.\n*   Applying interference reduction to low-rank TSVs results in lower approximation errors during orthogonalization compared to applying it to full-rank matrices.",
