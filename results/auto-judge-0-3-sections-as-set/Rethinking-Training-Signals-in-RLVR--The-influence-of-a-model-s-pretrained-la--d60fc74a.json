SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates the impact of pre-trained latent abilities on Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly when reward signals are weak or spurious. The study found that models like Qwen2.5-Math, which possess strong pre-trained \"code reasoning\" capabilities (generating Python code to assist in problem-solving without actual execution), show significant performance improvements on mathematical reasoning tasks even with random or incorrect rewards. This suggests that RLVR can effectively elicit these pre-existing latent abilities when the reward signal is not informative. In contrast, other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, lacking this specific pre-trained behavior, did not benefit from spurious rewards, indicating that the efficacy of RLVR with weak signals is highly dependent on the base model's inherent capabilities. The work highlights that RLVR might be surfacing these latent abilities rather than teaching new ones, and emphasizes the need for broader model validation in RLVR research.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance in models like Qwen2.5-Math, even with spurious (random, incorrect) reward signals.\n*   This improvement is strongly linked to the elicitation of pre-trained latent abilities, specifically \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid problem-solving).\n*   Models lacking these specific pre-trained reasoning patterns (e.g., Llama3, OLMo2) do not benefit from spurious rewards, highlighting model-dependency.\n*   The research hypothesizes that RLVR, particularly with weak rewards, surfaces existing reasoning representations learned during pre-training.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse models, not just those with strong, specific pre-trained abilities.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how pretrained latent abilities influence Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), even with low-quality or spurious reward signals. The study highlights that models like Qwen2.5-Math exhibit significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning tasks when trained with various spurious rewards (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, format-based rewards), often approaching the gains achieved with ground-truth rewards. This effect is largely attributed to RLVR's ability to elicit and upweight pre-existing reasoning strategies, such as \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for mathematical thinking), which are prevalent in Qwen models. Crucially, these gains are not generalizable to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, which lack similar pretrained reasoning capabilities. The findings suggest that RLVR's effectiveness is heavily dependent on the base model's latent abilities, underscoring the need for diverse model evaluations in future RLVR research. The paper also points to potential mechanisms within RL algorithms, like GRPO's clipping bias, that might amplify these latent behaviors even with noisy rewards.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in models like Qwen2.5-Math even with spurious or random reward signals, by eliciting latent abilities.\n*   The success of RLVR with spurious rewards is heavily dependent on the model's pretrained reasoning strategies, such as \"code reasoning\" in Qwen models.\n*   These observed gains with spurious rewards do not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, which lack comparable pretrained reasoning capabilities.\n*   RLVR training, particularly with spurious rewards, demonstrably increases the frequency of specific reasoning strategies (e.g., code reasoning) in Qwen models, correlating with performance improvements.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse models, not just a single de facto choice like Qwen, to understand the generalizability of findings.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research demonstrates that Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models even with weak or entirely spurious reward signals (e.g., random, incorrect labels, or format-based rewards). These gains are substantial, often approaching those achieved with ground truth rewards. Crucially, these positive effects are not generalizable across different model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, which show minimal or negative improvements with spurious rewards. The study hypothesizes that RLVR's effectiveness with weak signals stems from its ability to surface and upweight latent reasoning abilities acquired during pretraining. Specifically, Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong propensity for \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid reasoning without execution), which RLVR significantly amplifies, leading to performance gains. The research emphasizes that pretraining plays a critical role in determining RLVR outcomes and calls for broader model validation in future RLVR studies.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can elicit significant performance gains in Qwen2.5-Math models using weak or spurious reward signals, even reaching levels comparable to ground truth rewards.\n*   These gains are highly model-dependent; spurious rewards that benefit Qwen models often fail to improve other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is attributed to its ability to upweight pre-existing latent reasoning abilities, such as \"code reasoning,\" learned during pretraining, particularly in Qwen2.5-Math models.\n*   The study highlights the necessity for validating RLVR findings across diverse models due to the significant impact of pretraining on observed outcomes.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with spurious reward signals and their impact on a model's pre-trained latent abilities. The research demonstrates that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models even with rewards that have little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer. For instance, spurious rewards like random rewards or incorrect labels can lead to substantial accuracy gains, nearly matching those achieved with ground truth rewards. Crucially, this effectiveness is highly model-dependent. While Qwen models exhibit strong performance gains with spurious rewards, other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2 show minimal or no improvement, suggesting that the pre-trained latent abilities of the model play a critical role. Specifically, Qwen2.5-Math models demonstrate a pronounced \"code reasoning\" ability (thinking in code without execution), which becomes significantly more frequent after RLVR, even with spurious rewards. This highlights a key hypothesis: RLVR might be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned during pre-training, rather than teaching new capabilities. The findings underscore the need to validate RLVR research across diverse models, as observed effects might not generalize.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels) significantly improves mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, achieving gains comparable to ground truth rewards.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; these rewards largely fail to improve models like Llama3 and OLMo2.\n*   Qwen models exhibit strong pre-trained \"code reasoning\" capabilities, which are further amplified by RLVR, leading to increased code reasoning frequency and improved performance.\n*   The research suggests that RLVR may elicit latent reasoning abilities learned during pre-training, especially when the reward signal is weak or noisy.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse model families due to the observed model-specific nature of these gains.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with spurious (weak or incorrect) reward signals, particularly on models like Qwen2.5-Math, and how this interacts with their pretrained latent abilities. The study reveals that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning even with highly imperfect rewards, achieving gains comparable to ground truth rewards on Qwen2.5-Math models. This effectiveness is largely attributed to RLVR's ability to surface and upweight pre-existing reasoning strategies learned during pretraining. A key finding is that Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong \"code reasoning\" ability (thinking in Python without execution), which becomes significantly more frequent after RLVR, regardless of reward quality. This specific latent ability is crucial for the observed performance gains, as other model families lacking this or exhibiting \"bad code\" reasoning do not benefit from spurious rewards. The study emphasizes that RLVR's success is heavily model-dependent and that existing findings should be validated on diverse models, not just Qwen.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve substantial performance gains in mathematical reasoning even with spurious rewards (random, incorrect format) on Qwen2.5-Math models, nearly matching ground truth rewards.\n*   These gains are largely driven by RLVR's capacity to elicit and amplify pre-existing latent abilities within the model, such as \"code reasoning\" in Qwen2.5-Math.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models show a significant increase in code reasoning frequency (from 65% to over 90%) after RLVR with spurious rewards, correlating with improved accuracy.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2 do not benefit, suggesting differences in pretrained latent reasoning abilities.\n*   The research highlights the importance of validating RLVR findings across diverse models due to this observed model dependency.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with spurious reward signals, focusing on how a model's pretrained latent abilities influence outcomes. The research demonstrates that RLVR can elicit significant mathematical reasoning improvements in Qwen2.5-Math models even with rewards that have little, no, or negative correlation with the correct answer. This effect is particularly pronounced with \"code reasoning,\" a behavior where models generate Python code to aid their thought process without actual execution. Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a high pre-RLVR frequency of code reasoning (65%), which increases to over 90% after RLVR, even with spurious rewards, strongly correlating with performance gains. In contrast, other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2 show minimal or no improvement with spurious rewards, suggesting that the effectiveness of RLVR is heavily dependent on the model's pre-existing reasoning capabilities. Inducing or inhibiting code reasoning directly impacts performance, further supporting the hypothesis that RLVR primarily surfaces latent abilities rather than teaching new ones. The findings underscore the importance of validating RLVR research across diverse models, as the observed gains are not universally generalizable.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards significantly improves Qwen2.5-Math models by leveraging pretrained latent abilities, particularly \"code reasoning.\"\n*   Code reasoning, a model behavior of generating Python code for mathematical thought processes, is highly prevalent in Qwen2.5-Math models and is further amplified by RLVR, leading to performance gains.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; Qwen models benefit significantly, while Llama and OLMo models do not, indicating that pretrained reasoning capabilities are crucial.\n*   Directly inducing or inhibiting code reasoning demonstrates a causal link between this latent ability and RLVR performance improvements.\n*   The research emphasizes the need for diverse model validation in RLVR studies, as findings on one model family may not generalize.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how a model's pretrained latent abilities influence Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) outcomes, even with low-quality or spurious reward signals. The study found that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models using rewards that are random, incorrectly labeled, or merely based on output format. These gains, sometimes comparable to using ground truth rewards, were attributed to RLVR's ability to surface and upweight pre-existing reasoning strategies learned during pretraining. A key example is \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid reasoning without execution), which Qwen2.5-Math models utilize frequently and benefits greatly from RLVR, even with spurious rewards. In contrast, other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2 showed minimal or negative improvements under similar spurious reward conditions, indicating that the effectiveness of RLVR with weak signals is highly model-dependent and tied to their pre-existing capabilities. The findings underscore the importance of validating RLVR techniques across diverse models and suggest that pretraining's influence on latent abilities is a critical factor in RLVR success.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve substantial performance gains in Qwen2.5-Math models even with entirely random or incorrect reward signals, suggesting it amplifies latent pretrained abilities.\n*   \"Code reasoning,\" a specific pretrained capability of Qwen2.5-Math models, is significantly upweighted by RLVR and strongly correlates with improved accuracy, even under spurious reward conditions.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards does not generalize across model families; Llama3 and OLMo2 models show little to no improvement, highlighting the role of pretraining in shaping RLVR outcomes.\n*   The study emphasizes the need to test RLVR advancements on diverse model architectures, not just Qwen models, as observed effects may be model-specific due to differences in pretrained latent abilities.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with spurious or weak reward signals, particularly focusing on how a model's pre-trained latent abilities influence these outcomes. The research demonstrates that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models even with rewards that have little to no correlation with correctness. This effect is attributed to RLVR's ability to surface and upweight pre-existing reasoning strategies learned during pre-training, rather than teaching new capabilities. Notably, the Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong predisposition for \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid reasoning without execution), which significantly correlates with higher accuracy. When RLVR is applied, even with spurious rewards, this code reasoning behavior becomes more frequent, leading to substantial performance gains. Crucially, these gains are not generalizable to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, which lack this specific pre-trained capability. Interventions to explicitly induce or inhibit code reasoning further validate this hypothesis, showing performance improvements on Qwen models when code reasoning is encouraged and degradation when inhibited. The study concludes that the effectiveness of RLVR with weak signals is heavily dependent on the model's inherent latent abilities and strongly advocates for diverse model validation in future RLVR research.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels) can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models by eliciting latent abilities.\n*   The \"code reasoning\" capability, where models generate Python code to aid problem-solving, is a key pre-trained latent ability that Qwen2.5-Math models possess and which RLVR amplifies, leading to higher accuracy.\n*   These gains are highly model-dependent; similar RLVR approaches with spurious rewards fail to improve other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, which lack comparable pre-trained reasoning strategies.\n*   Explicitly inducing or inhibiting code reasoning through interventions confirms its role in driving performance gains with RLVR, particularly for models like Qwen2.5-Math that already exhibit this behavior.\n*   The findings highlight the importance of considering a model's pre-trained latent abilities and the need for diverse model validation in RLVR research, as effects observed on one model family may not generalize.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with spurious reward signals, focusing on how a model's pretrained latent abilities, such as \"code reasoning,\" influence outcomes. The study found that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models even with rewards that have little to no correlation with the correct answer (e.g., random, format, or incorrect labels). These spurious rewards elicited substantial performance gains, often comparable to ground truth rewards. Crucially, this effect was highly model-dependent; similar spurious rewards failed to yield gains or even degraded performance on other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2. The paper hypothesizes that RLVR, especially with weak signals, surfaces latent reasoning representations learned during pretraining. For Qwen2.5-Math models, \"code reasoning\"—generating Python code to aid mathematical thought processes—was identified as a key latent ability that RLVR upweights, leading to performance improvements. Interventions to explicitly induce or inhibit code reasoning further supported this hypothesis. The findings underscore the importance of considering pretrained model capabilities and validating RLVR research across diverse models, not just Qwen variants.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve significant performance gains in Qwen2.5-Math models even with entirely spurious reward signals (random, incorrect labels, format-based).\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards in RLVR is highly model-dependent, with Qwen models benefiting significantly while Llama3 and OLMo2 models show minimal or negative gains.\n*   \"Code reasoning\" (generating code to aid mathematical thought) is a key pretrained latent ability in Qwen2.5-Math models that RLVR effectively upweights, leading to performance improvements.\n*   Interventions that explicitly induce code reasoning boost Qwen2.5-Math model performance, while inhibiting it can reduce gains, confirming the role of this latent ability.\n*   The study highlights that RLVR often surfaces and amplifies existing pretrained capabilities rather than teaching entirely new ones, emphasizing the importance of base model properties.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with spurious (weak or incorrect) reward signals on language models' mathematical reasoning abilities. The core finding is that RLVR can significantly improve performance, even with low-quality rewards, particularly for Qwen2.5-Math models. This improvement is largely attributed to RLVR's ability to surface and upweight latent reasoning capabilities acquired during pre-training, rather than teaching new skills. A key pre-existing ability identified in Qwen2.5-Math models is \"code reasoning\" (thinking in code without execution), which is strongly correlated with accuracy. RLVR, even with spurious rewards, substantially increases the frequency of code reasoning in Qwen models. Crucially, these gains do not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, which lack similar pre-trained reasoning patterns. This highlights a significant model dependency, suggesting that RLVR research should be validated across diverse models to avoid drawing conclusions based on the specific, pre-trained abilities of a single model family.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve substantial performance gains in mathematical reasoning even with weak or spurious reward signals, especially for Qwen2.5-Math models.\n*   These gains are primarily due to RLVR eliciting and amplifying pre-trained latent abilities, such as \"code reasoning\" in Qwen models, which correlate with accuracy.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, with Qwen models showing significant benefits while Llama3 and OLMo2 models do not.\n*   The findings underscore the importance of validating RLVR techniques across diverse model families to understand their true generalizability and the role of pre-trained latent abilities.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates the impact of pre-trained latent abilities on Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly when using suboptimal or \"spurious\" reward signals. The study finds that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in certain models, such as Qwen2.5-Math, even with rewards that have little to no correlation with correctness. This improvement is attributed to RLVR's ability to elicit and upweight pre-existing reasoning strategies learned during pre-training, such as \"code reasoning\" (thinking in code without execution). Qwen2.5-Math models, for instance, show a marked increase in code reasoning frequency and accuracy after RLVR, even with random or incorrect rewards. Crucially, these benefits are not generalizable to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, which lack these specific pre-trained reasoning patterns. The findings suggest that pre-training plays a critical role in RLVR outcomes, and that spurious rewards can be effective by surfacing these latent abilities. The paper emphasizes the need for cross-model validation in RLVR research.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n* RLVR can achieve significant performance gains even with spurious reward signals that are unrelated or even negatively correlated with the correct answer.\n* The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, with Qwen2.5-Math models showing substantial improvements, while Llama3 and OLMo2 models do not.\n* Pre-trained latent abilities, such as \"code reasoning\" in Qwen2.5-Math, are significantly amplified by RLVR, leading to performance improvements even without high-quality reward signals.\n* RLVR with spurious rewards primarily elicits and upweights existing reasoning strategies rather than teaching new ones.\n* The findings highlight the importance of considering model-specific pre-training data and latent abilities when applying RLVR, and the need to validate findings across diverse model architectures.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) on language models, particularly concerning the influence of pre-trained latent abilities, even with low-quality or spurious reward signals. The study reveals that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, even when using rewards that are random, incorrectly labeled, or merely based on output format. These improvements are substantial, sometimes approaching gains achieved with ground truth rewards. A key finding is that these spurious rewards are highly model-dependent; they work effectively for Qwen models but largely fail for other families like Llama3 and OLMo2. This divergence is attributed to pre-trained latent abilities, specifically identifying \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid reasoning without actual execution) as a distinct and beneficial behavior in Qwen models. RLVR successfully upweights this pre-existing code reasoning capability, leading to performance gains. Conversely, models lacking this latent ability do not benefit from spurious rewards, highlighting the critical role of pre-training in RLVR outcomes. The research emphasizes the need for cross-model validation in RLVR studies, as findings on one model family may not generalize.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness, particularly concerning the influence of a model's pretrained latent abilities, even with spurious or low-quality reward signals. The research demonstrates that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models even when trained with rewards that are random, incorrect, or only based on output format. These spurious rewards elicit substantial performance gains, often comparable to ground truth rewards. A key finding is that this effect is highly model-dependent: Qwen2.5-Math models benefit significantly due to their pre-existing \"code reasoning\" ability (generating Python code for mathematical thinking), which RLVR upweights. Other model families, like Llama3 and OLMo2, do not show similar gains with spurious rewards, suggesting a lack of comparable pretrained latent abilities. The study highlights that RLVR often surfaces and amplifies existing capabilities rather than teaching new ones, emphasizing the critical role of pretraining and the need for cross-model validation in RLVR research.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve significant performance gains in mathematical reasoning even with entirely spurious reward signals (e.g., random or incorrect rewards), particularly on Qwen2.5-Math models.\n*   These gains are attributed to RLVR's ability to elicit and upweight latent, pretrained reasoning abilities, such as \"code reasoning\" (using Python for mathematical thought), which are present in Qwen2.5-Math but not in other tested models like Llama3 or OLMo2.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, underscoring the crucial influence of a model's pretraining data and learned behaviors on its response to reinforcement learning signals.\n*   The study advocates for testing RLVR methods across diverse model architectures and families, as findings from one model (like Qwen2.5-Math) may not generalize, and spurious rewards can be easily exploited on models with specific pretrained strengths.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates how pretrained latent abilities influence Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) outcomes, even with low-quality or \"spurious\" reward signals. The research demonstrates that models like Qwen2.5-Math can achieve significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning tasks (e.g., MATH-500) using rewards that are random, incorrect, or only based on output format. These gains are often comparable to those achieved with ground-truth rewards. Crucially, this effect is highly model-dependent, with spurious rewards failing to improve other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2. The study identifies \"code reasoning\" – generating Python code to aid mathematical thought without execution – as a key latent ability of Qwen2.5-Math. RLVR, even with spurious rewards, significantly upweights this code reasoning behavior, leading to improved accuracy. This suggests that RLVR can effectively surface and amplify pre-existing, beneficial reasoning strategies, regardless of the reward signal's quality, provided the model possesses such latent abilities. The findings underscore the importance of validating RLVR research across diverse models due to this strong model-specific dependency.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance even with spurious rewards (random, incorrect format) on models like Qwen2.5-Math.\n*   These gains are largely model-dependent, with other families like Llama3 and OLMo2 showing little to no improvement with spurious rewards.\n*   \"Code reasoning\" (generating code for thought processes) is a key latent ability in Qwen2.5-Math that RLVR, even with spurious rewards, effectively upweights, correlating with accuracy gains.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious signals hinges on the model's pre-existing reasoning capabilities that can be elicited, rather than the quality of the reward signal itself.\n*   The findings highlight a critical need for cross-model validation in RLVR research, as observed effects are not universally generalizable.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) on language models, particularly focusing on how pretrained latent abilities influence outcomes, even with low-quality or spurious reward signals. The study reveals that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models using rewards that are incorrect, random, or only consider output format. These gains are substantial, often approaching those achieved with ground truth rewards. However, these spurious rewards are not generalizable and fail to improve other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2. The key differentiator for Qwen2.5-Math models is their pre-existing \"code reasoning\" ability—generating Python code to aid problem-solving. RLVR, even with spurious rewards, effectively upweights this latent capability, increasing its frequency and correlating with improved accuracy. This suggests that RLVR's effectiveness, especially with weak signals, is highly dependent on the model's pretrained reasoning strategies, highlighting the need for cross-model validation in RLVR research.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve significant performance gains in Qwen2.5-Math models using spurious reward signals (e.g., random, incorrect formatting) that are largely ineffective on other model families.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is strongly linked to the model's pretrained latent abilities, specifically the \"code reasoning\" capability observed in Qwen2.5-Math models.\n*   RLVR, even with poor reward signals, tends to upweight and increase the frequency of these pre-existing reasoning strategies, leading to improved outcomes for models like Qwen2.5-Math.\n*   The observed benefits of RLVR with spurious rewards do not generalize across different model architectures, underscoring the importance of model-specific pretraining on RLVR outcomes.",
