The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset for a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Experiments revealed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) within the first 50-100 training steps using limited data and computational resources. However, prolonged training led to optimization instability and performance degradation. Key challenges identified include the model's struggle with strict length constraints, which caused premature truncation of reasoning processes, and language drift due to the multilingual nature of the base model. The cosine reward function was found to stabilize completion lengths, but extending length limits is still necessary for highly complex tasks. Despite these issues, the approach demonstrates a cost-effective alternative to large-scale methods, achieving competitive performance with minimal resources.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements rapidly (50-100 steps) with RL and limited high-quality data under resource constraints.\n*   Prolonged RL fine-tuning of small LLMs leads to optimization instability and performance degradation, particularly when facing strict output length constraints.\n*   Strict maximum completion lengths can cause premature truncation of reasoning processes, hindering performance on complex tasks.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model can lead to language drift and output inconsistencies in small LLMs during extended RL training.\n*   A cosine reward function can help stabilize output lengths, but extending length limits is crucial for highly complex reasoning tasks.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the impact of reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning on small language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks, particularly focusing on optimization instability and performance degradation. Using a 1.5B parameter model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) under strict computational constraints, the research highlights that while RL can rapidly improve reasoning abilities within the first 50-100 training steps, prolonged training leads to degradation. Experiment 1 showed performance drops after 200 steps, attributed to exceeding token limits. Experiment 2, which mixed easy and hard problems, offered better initial stability but still degraded after 150-200 steps, with unstable KL divergence. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to control output length, improving training consistency but sacrificing peak accuracy and not fully resolving issues with multilingual base models. The multilingual nature of the base model contributed to language drift, suggesting a need for explicit language controls or longer context windows for complex tasks. The findings indicate that small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning gains cost-effectively, but face challenges with optimization stability and length constraints during extended fine-tuning.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Prolonged RL fine-tuning beyond 150-200 steps on small LLMs leads to performance degradation and optimization instability.\n*   Exceeding token limits (e.g., 4096 tokens) contributes to performance decline and output quality issues in early experiments.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems can improve initial reasoning stability but does not prevent later-stage degradation.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) can cause language drift during fine-tuning, requiring specific mitigation strategies.\n*   Cosine rewards help stabilize completion lengths, but might limit peak performance on complex tasks and do not fully address multilingual issues.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the effectiveness and challenges of using reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of small language models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints. The research utilized a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and adapted the GRPO algorithm with a curated mathematical reasoning dataset. Early experiments demonstrated rapid reasoning gains, with AMC23 accuracy increasing from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7% within 50-100 training steps. However, prolonged training led to optimization instability and performance degradation. Specifically, Experiment 1 showed accuracy dropping significantly after 200 steps, attributed to the model exceeding token limits and reward misalignment. Experiment 2, which mixed easier and harder problems, improved initial stability and performance but still encountered degradation and unstable KL divergence after 150-200 steps. Experiment 3 introduced a cosine reward for better length control, stabilizing completion lengths but slightly reducing peak performance compared to Experiment 2. The multilingual nature of the base model was identified as a factor contributing to language drift and degradation. Overall, the findings highlight RL's potential for cost-effective reasoning enhancement in small LLMs, while also identifying optimization instability and length constraints as key challenges.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 from 63% to 80%) within the first 50-100 RL fine-tuning steps using high-quality data, but performance degrades significantly after approximately 200 steps.\n*   Optimization instability, including unstable KL divergence and performance degradation, emerged in experiments after 150-200 steps, exacerbated by strict token limits that caused models to exceed them and lead to unreadable or mixed-language outputs.\n*   Mixing easier and harder problems (Experiment 2) improved initial stability and performance compared to using only hard problems (Experiment 1), but long-term stability remained an issue.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model contributed to language drift and degradation, even with explicit instructions to use English.\n*   Cosine rewards effectively stabilized completion lengths, improving training consistency, but this came at the cost of slightly lower peak performance compared to methods that allowed longer outputs.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under strict computational constraints. The research utilized a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, fine-tuned using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and a curated mathematical reasoning dataset. The experiments revealed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains within the first 50-100 training steps, significantly improving performance on benchmarks like AMC23 and AIME24 with minimal data and cost ($42). However, prolonged training led to optimization instability and performance degradation, particularly after 150-200 steps. This degradation was linked to challenges with strict token length constraints, where models struggled to complete complex reasoning chains, and the multilingual nature of the base model, which contributed to language drift. Experiment 2, by mixing easier and harder problems, showed improved initial performance and more stable behavior, but long-term stability remained an issue. Experiment 3’s use of a cosine reward successfully controlled output lengths, enhancing training consistency, but at the cost of slightly lower peak performance. The findings demonstrate RL's viability for resource-constrained reasoning enhancement in small LLMs, while also highlighting critical areas for future improvement.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements with RL within 50-100 steps, but performance degrades rapidly thereafter, often after 150-200 steps, due to optimization instability and length constraints.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems (Experiment 2) improved initial performance and stabilized reasoning behavior compared to using only hard problems (Experiment 1), though long-term stability was still a challenge.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) negatively impacted stability and led to language drift during prolonged fine-tuning.\n*   Cosine rewards effectively controlled output length, improving training consistency, but this came with a trade-off, slightly sacrificing peak performance compared to accuracy rewards.\n*   The approach achieved competitive reasoning performance on benchmarks like AIME24 and AMC23 with minimal data and cost ($42), outperforming other 1.5B models and rivaling some 7B models.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the effectiveness and challenges of using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints. The research fine-tuned a 1.5 billion-parameter model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and a curated mathematical reasoning dataset. The experiments revealed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains within the first 50-100 training steps, improving accuracy on benchmarks like AMC23 from 63% to 80%. However, prolonged training, especially with strict token limits (e.g., 4096 tokens), led to optimization instability and performance degradation, characterized by accuracy drops and increased completion lengths, sometimes exceeding the limit. The multilingual nature of the base model also contributed to language drift. While mixing easier and harder problems (Experiment 2) and using cosine rewards for length control (Experiment 3) showed some stabilization, persistent issues with long-term stability and language consistency remained. Despite these challenges, the approach demonstrated significant cost and data efficiency compared to larger models, achieving competitive results with minimal resources.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 from 63% to 80%) within the first 50-100 RL fine-tuning steps, but prolonged training leads to optimization instability and performance degradation.\n*   Strict token limits (e.g., 4096 tokens) exacerbate degradation, causing models to exceed limits and exhibit unstable behavior, including language drift, especially with multilingual base models.\n*   The RL fine-tuning approach is highly cost-effective, achieving competitive performance with minimal data ($42 cost for 7,000 samples) compared to thousands of dollars for larger models.\n*   While mixing easier/harder problems and using cosine rewards offer some stabilization, challenges like language drift and the need for extended context for complex tasks persist.\n*   The study highlights the potential of RL for small LLMs but also points to limitations in training duration and generalizability to other domains.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the efficacy of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints. The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and a curated mathematical reasoning dataset for a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Initial experiments demonstrated rapid reasoning gains, with AMC23 accuracy increasing from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, surpassing baselines at a significantly lower cost ($42 vs. thousands). However, prolonged training led to optimization instability and performance degradation, particularly beyond 100-200 steps. This degradation was linked to issues like exceeding token limits (4096, later 3584), reward misalignment, and the base model's multilingual nature, which caused language drift. Experiment 2, which mixed easier and harder problems, showed improved initial stability but still suffered late-stage degradation. Experiment 3's use of a cosine reward helped control output length but didn't fully resolve language drift or achieve peak performance. Limitations include insufficient training duration and token limits for complex tasks, and lack of domain generalization testing. Future work suggests extending training, addressing language drift with explicit constraints, and exploring hybrid methods.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements with RL and limited data, but prolonged training leads to optimization instability and performance degradation.\n*   Key causes of degradation include exceeding token limits, reward misalignment, and the base model's inherent multilingual nature causing language drift.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems can improve initial stability, while cosine rewards help control output length but don't fully resolve underlying issues.\n*   The approach demonstrates a cost-effective method for enhancing small LLM reasoning, achieving competitive results at a fraction of the cost of larger models.\n*   Limitations include insufficient training duration and token limits for complex reasoning tasks, and lack of generalization to domains beyond mathematics.",

Researchers fine-tuned a 1.5-billion-parameter model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and a curated mathematical reasoning dataset. Initial experiments showed rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) within 50-100 steps. However, prolonged training led to optimization instability and performance degradation, particularly beyond 200 steps. This degradation was linked to exceeding token limits, reward misalignment, and the base model's multilingual nature causing language drift. Experiment 2, mixing easier problems, improved initial stability but still faced issues. Experiment 3, using a cosine reward, better controlled output length but didn't fully resolve language drift or peak performance. Despite these challenges, the approach achieved competitive performance with significantly lower costs ($42 vs. thousands) and data usage compared to larger models, demonstrating RL's potential for resource-constrained reasoning enhancement, though limitations in training duration, length constraints, and domain generalization remain.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements with RL within the first 50-100 training steps, but performance degrades with prolonged training due to optimization instability.\n*   Exceeding token limits and reward misalignment are key causes of degradation, often manifesting after 200 steps, leading to unstable accuracy and increased output lengths.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) contributes to language drift and complicates monolingual optimization, especially under length constraints.\n*   While mixing easier problems (Experiment 2) and using cosine rewards (Experiment 3) offer improvements in stability and length control, they don't fully resolve long-term degradation or language issues.\n*   RL fine-tuning for small LLMs is highly cost-effective ($42) and data-efficient, achieving performance competitive with larger models, but limitations in training duration and domain generalization persist.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints. The research highlights that while RL fine-tuning can lead to rapid reasoning improvements in small LLMs, achieving significant gains within the first 50-100 training steps, prolonged training can lead to optimization instability and performance degradation. This degradation is often linked to exceeding token limits for complex problems and inherent issues with the base model's multilingual nature, causing language drift. Experiment 1 demonstrated that performance dropped significantly after 200 steps due to these factors. Experiment 2 showed that mixing easier problems with harder ones improved initial performance and stabilized behavior, but instability persisted. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to better control output length, improving training consistency but still facing multilingual issues. The findings suggest that while RL is a cost-effective method for improving small LLMs' reasoning, careful consideration of training duration, data mix, length constraints, and base model characteristics is crucial to mitigate instability and performance decay.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RL fine-tuning can rapidly improve small LLM reasoning within 50-100 steps, but prolonged training leads to optimization instability and performance degradation.\n*   Exceeding maximum token limits and the multilingual nature of the base model contribute to degradation, causing language drift and truncated reasoning.\n*   Mixing easier and harder problems (Experiment 2) can improve initial performance and stability, while cosine rewards (Experiment 3) help control output length but don't fully solve multilingual issues.\n*   The research demonstrates a cost-effective approach ($42) for enhancing small LLMs' reasoning, significantly outperforming larger models in specific metrics like AIME24 with minimal data.\n*   Future work should focus on extending training durations, exploring multi-stage length schedules, and addressing multilingualism to mitigate degradation and improve generalizability.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the efficacy of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small language models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints. The research highlights that while RL can lead to rapid reasoning improvements in small LLMs (e.g., a 1.5B parameter model seeing an increase in AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%), prolonged training or specific experimental setups can lead to optimization instability and performance degradation. Key causes identified include exceeding token limits for complex problems, leading to truncated reasoning and nonsensical outputs. The multilingual nature of the base model also contributes to language drift during extended training. Strategies like mixing easier and harder problems or using cosine rewards can improve initial stability and control output length, but do not fully resolve long-term instability. The findings suggest that while RL is a cost-effective method for boosting small LLM reasoning, careful management of training duration, length constraints, and base model characteristics is crucial to avoid performance degradation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning gains through RL, but prolonged training can lead to optimization instability and performance degradation.\n*   Exceeding token limits for complex problems is a primary cause of degradation, resulting in truncated reasoning and non-English outputs.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, contributes to language drift and complicates monolingual optimization.\n*   Strategies like mixing easier/harder problems and using cosine rewards can improve initial stability and length control but do not entirely prevent late-stage degradation.\n*   RL fine-tuning offers a cost-effective alternative to large-scale approaches for small LLMs, but careful management of training length and constraints is necessary.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints. The researchers fine-tuned a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and a curated, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset. Initial experiments demonstrated rapid reasoning gains, with accuracy on AMC23 increasing from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, surpassing baselines at a significantly lower cost ($42). However, prolonged training led to optimization instability and performance degradation, particularly beyond 100-200 steps. This degradation was attributed to issues such as exceeding token limits, reward misalignment, and the multilingual nature of the base model. Experiment 2, which mixed easier and harder problems, showed improved initial stability but still faced late-stage instability. Experiment 3, using a cosine reward, better controlled output length but slightly reduced peak performance. The study concludes that RL is a viable, cost-effective method for small LLMs, but challenges like optimization stability, length constraints, and language drift need careful management for sustained performance.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements with RL and limited high-quality data within 50-100 steps, but prolonged training leads to performance degradation.\n*   Optimization instability and performance decline in small LLMs during RL fine-tuning are often linked to exceeding token limits and reward misalignment.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, contributed to language drift and degradation issues in later training stages.\n*   Mixing easier and harder problems can enhance early performance and stabilize reasoning, while cosine rewards help control output length, though these methods don't fully resolve long-term instability.\n*   RL fine-tuning offers a cost-effective way to boost small LLM reasoning, achieving competitive results with minimal data and computational resources compared to larger models.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of small language models (LLMs), specifically a 1.5-billion-parameter model, under significant resource constraints. The research highlights that while RL can rapidly improve reasoning performance in small LLMs within the initial 50-100 training steps (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%), prolonged training leads to optimization instability and performance degradation. This degradation is attributed to factors like exceeding token limits, reward misalignment, and the inherent multilingual nature of the base model, which can cause language drift. Experiment 1 showed accuracy dropping significantly past 200 steps due to these issues. Experiment 2, by mixing easier and harder problems, improved initial stability but still faced degradation. Experiment 3 used a cosine reward to better control output length, improving consistency but not peak performance. These findings suggest that while RL is effective for small LLMs, careful management of training duration, data mix, reward functions, and length constraints is crucial to avoid instability and performance decay.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains with RL within the first 50-100 training steps, but prolonged training leads to optimization instability and performance degradation.\n*   Key causes of degradation include exceeding maximum completion token limits, reward misalignment, and the multilingual nature of the base model leading to language drift.\n*   Experiment 1 showed accuracy dropping below initial levels after 200 steps due to these factors, particularly exceeding token limits.\n*   Mixing easier and harder problems (Experiment 2) improved initial stability but did not fully resolve long-term instability, while cosine rewards (Experiment 3) better controlled length at the cost of peak performance.\n*   The study demonstrates that RL fine-tuning can be cost-effective for small LLMs, achieving competitive results with minimal data and computational resources, but careful tuning is required to mitigate instability.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the efficacy of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints. Researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset for a 1.5-billion-parameter model. Initial experiments showed rapid reasoning gains within 50-100 training steps, with accuracy on AMC23 improving from 63% to 80%. However, prolonged training led to optimization instability and performance degradation. Specifically, Experiment 1 demonstrated accuracy drops beyond 200 steps, linked to exceeding token limits and reward misalignment. Experiment 2, by mixing easier and harder problems, improved initial performance and stabilized behavior but still showed instability and language drift after 150-200 steps, attributed to mixed-language base model characteristics and KL divergence issues. Experiment 3 used a cosine reward to control output length, improving consistency but not peak performance, and highlighting the need for longer completion lengths for complex tasks, especially with multilingual base models. The study concludes that while RL is effective for small LLMs with limited data and cost, challenges like optimization instability and length constraints persist, requiring careful tuning and future research into mitigating language drift and extending reasoning chains.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements with RL in early training stages (50-100 steps) but suffer from optimization instability and performance degradation with prolonged training.\n*   Performance degradation in small LLMs during RL fine-tuning is linked to exceeding token limits, reward misalignment, and the multilingual nature of the base model, leading to language drift.\n*   Mixing easier and harder problems can stabilize training and improve initial performance, but challenges like KL divergence instability and language drift can reemerge in later stages.\n*   Cosine rewards help control output length and improve training consistency, but insufficient completion lengths hinder performance on very hard tasks, especially for multilingual base models.\n*   The study demonstrates a cost-effective approach to RL fine-tuning for small LLMs, achieving competitive reasoning performance with significantly less data and computational resources than larger models.",

Researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset. They found that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) with minimal data and cost ($42). However, prolonged training led to optimization instability and performance degradation. Specifically, Experiment 1 showed accuracy declining after 200 steps, attributed to exceeding token limits and reward misalignment. Experiment 2, using a mix of easy and hard problems with reduced token limits, improved initial performance but still faced instability and multilingual issues past 150-200 steps, linked to unstable KL divergence. Experiment 3 used a cosine reward to better control output length, improving consistency but slightly lowering peak performance. Limitations include insufficient token limits for complex tasks and language drift due to the base model's multilingual nature, suggesting future work on extended training, adaptive length controls, and explicit language constraints.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements with RL, but prolonged training leads to optimization instability and performance degradation.\n*   Exceeding token limits and reward misalignment are key causes of degradation in early experiments.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model contributes to language drift and complicates monolingual optimization.\n*   A mix of easy/hard data and cosine rewards can improve initial stability and length control, but long-term issues persist.\n*   RL fine-tuning offers a cost-effective and data-efficient alternative for enhancing small LLM reasoning, achieving competitive results with minimal resources.",

The researchers adapted the GRPO algorithm and curated a high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset. Key findings indicate that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) within 50-100 training steps, significantly outperforming baselines with minimal cost ($42). However, prolonged training leads to optimization instability and performance degradation, particularly due to token limits and the multilingual nature of the base model. Experiment 1 showed degradation after 200 steps, linked to exceeding token limits and reward misalignment. Experiment 2, mixing easy and hard problems, improved initial stability but still faced late-stage instability. Experiment 3 used a cosine reward to control output length, stabilizing it but slightly reducing peak performance. Limitations include insufficient length limits for complex tasks and language drift from the multilingual base model. Future work could explore extended training, better language control, and broader domain evaluation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) with RL fine-tuning within 50-100 steps, at a fraction of the cost of larger models.\n*   Prolonged RL training beyond 100-200 steps can lead to optimization instability, performance degradation, and issues like language drift and token limit exceedance.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) contributes to language drift and complicates monolingual optimization.\n*   Strict token limits (e.g., 3584-4096 tokens) are a significant constraint, hindering the model's ability to complete complex reasoning tasks and contributing to performance degradation.\n*   While cosine rewards help stabilize output length, they may trade off peak performance, and addressing language drift requires explicit control mechanisms or longer context windows for complex tasks.",
