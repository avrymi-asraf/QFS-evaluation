SUMMARY:\nThis paper proposes a novel multi-stage knowledge distillation framework to enable smaller student embedding models to learn from multiple larger, state-of-the-art teacher models. The methodology addresses the challenge of high parameter counts and vector dimensionality in top-performing embedding models, making them impractical for real-world applications. The framework utilizes three carefully designed losses: cosine loss for aligning absolute representations, similarity loss for capturing semantic discrepancies between text pairs, and relative similarity distillation loss for learning ranking preferences. To further improve efficiency, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed to reduce the student model's vector dimensionality. The proposed 2 billion parameter student model, Jasper, built upon the Stella embedding model, achieves performance comparable to 7 billion parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of this multi-teacher distillation approach for creating efficient yet powerful embedding models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A multi-stage distillation framework is introduced to transfer knowledge from multiple large teacher embedding models to a smaller student model.\n*   Three distinct loss functions (cosine, similarity, and relative similarity) are used to progressively capture different aspects of teacher model representations.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized for effective reduction of the student model's vector dimensionality.\n*   The resulting 2B parameter Jasper model achieves performance comparable to larger 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark.",

The methodology focuses on fusing knowledge from heterogeneous teacher models, specifically NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5, into a student model named Jasper. Stages 1 and 2 involve a multi-stage distillation process using three carefully designed losses: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. These losses progressively align the student's representations with the teachers', moving from specific to broader semantic matching. Stage 3 addresses the challenge of high dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher vectors by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers for effective dimension reduction. Stage 4 explores unlocking multimodal potential by training a vision encoder using self-distillation, aligning image embeddings with textual embeddings from captions. Jasper, with 2 billion parameters, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, significantly outperforming other models in its size class. Hyperparameters like learning rates and batch sizes were meticulously tuned across the four stages, with specific settings for each phase to optimize the distillation process.\n\n2.

The methodology focuses on fusing knowledge from heterogeneous teacher models, specifically using NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5. Ground truth vectors are created by concatenating teacher model outputs. The framework employs three carefully designed losses: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss, progressively capturing broader semantic relationships. Stages 1 and 2 differ in trained parameters, with Stage 1 training only a mapping layer, and Stage 2 also training the last three encoder layers. Stage 3 utilizes Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional FC layers for effective dimension reduction, from 12288D down to 512D, using similarity and relative similarity losses. Stage 4 aims to unlock multimodal potential by training a vision encoder using self-distillation, aligning image embeddings with text embeddings from earlier stages. The resulting Jasper model, with 2 billion parameters, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, ranking third. Implementation details include specific hyperparameters and a four-stage training setup.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   **Methodology for fusing knowledge:** A multi-stage distillation framework using cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss to transfer knowledge from multiple SOTA teacher models.\n*   **Ground Truth Vector Creation:** Concatenates normalized vectors from multiple teacher models to form the target representation for the student.\n*   **Stage 3 Dimension Reduction:** Employs Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers to reduce high-dimensional concatenated vectors (12288D) to lower dimensions (e.g., 512D), using similarity-based losses.\n*   **Jasper Model Performance:** Achieved No. 3 on the MTEB leaderboard with 2B parameters, comparable to 7B models, demonstrating efficient knowledge fusion.\n*   **Stage 1 & 2 Parameter Differences:** Stage 1 trains only a mapping FC layer, while Stage 2 includes the last three encoder layers of the student model in addition to the mapping layer.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces a multi-stage knowledge distillation framework for creating smaller, efficient text embedding models from larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teachers. The methodology focuses on fusing knowledge from heterogeneous teacher models by employing a progression of three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (for aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (for semantic matching of text pairs), and relative similarity distillation loss (for learning ranking preferences). This approach allows a student model, Jasper, built upon the Stella embedding model, to distill knowledge from multiple SOTA teachers like NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5. To manage the high dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher vectors, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is applied in Stage 3 for effective dimension reduction. Stage 4 further enhances the model by incorporating a vision encoder and using self-distillation for preliminary multimodal alignment. Jasper, with 2 billion parameters, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, demonstrating a significant improvement over other models in its parameter class.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The methodology employs a multi-stage distillation process using cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss to fuse knowledge from heterogeneous teacher models.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized in Stage 3 to address the high dimensionality issue arising from concatenating teacher model vectors.\n*   Stage 4 incorporates a vision encoder and self-distillation for initial multimodal alignment, though further improvements are noted.\n*   Jasper, a 2B parameter model, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, outperforming other models in its parameter size class.\n*   The distillation process leverages unsupervised text data, eliminating the need for task-specific labeled data.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper details a novel multi-stage knowledge distillation framework for creating smaller, efficient embedding models from larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models. The methodology involves three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss for direct vector alignment, similarity loss for semantic matching between text pairs, and relative similarity distillation loss for capturing ranking preferences. This progressive approach ensures the student model learns from specific to broader semantic relationships. To handle the high dimensionality resulting from concatenating multiple teacher vectors, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed in Stage 3 to reduce vector dimensions effectively. Stage 4 further enhances the model by integrating a vision encoder and using self-distillation for multimodal alignment. The resulting Jasper model (2B parameters) demonstrates performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, significantly outperforming other models in its size class. The training involves distinct stages with specific parameter updates and hyperparameters, including learning rates and batch sizes tailored for each phase.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A multi-stage distillation framework uses cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity loss to transfer knowledge from heterogeneous SOTA teacher models to a smaller student model.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is applied in Stage 3 to effectively reduce the high dimensionality of the student model's vectors created by concatenating teacher outputs.\n*   The Jasper model (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, showcasing significant efficiency gains.\n*   Stage 4 incorporates a vision encoder and self-distillation for preliminary multimodal alignment.\n*   The distillation process progresses through four stages, with specific parameter training, loss function usage, and hyperparameters defined for each stage.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, developed using a multi-stage knowledge distillation framework to fuse knowledge from heterogeneous state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher embedding models. The methodology focuses on progressive knowledge transfer through three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute text representations), similarity loss (capturing semantic matching from a text-pair perspective), and relative similarity distillation loss (leveraging relative ranking information). To handle multiple teacher models, their output vectors are concatenated, creating a high-dimensional ground truth. Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is then employed in Stage 3 to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model. Stage 4 further enhances Jasper by integrating a vision encoder and using self-distillation for multimodal alignment. Jasper achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, outperforming other models in its parameter class.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a multi-stage distillation framework using cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss to fuse knowledge from multiple SOTA teacher models.\n*   The methodology concatenates vectors from teacher models to create a high-dimensional ground truth, which is then reduced using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL).\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, significantly outperforming other models in its size class.\n*   Stage 4 integrates a vision encoder and uses self-distillation for preliminary multimodal alignment.",

The methodology addresses the challenge of high dimensionality and parameter count in SOTA models, making them impractical for real-world applications. The framework utilizes three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (for absolute representation alignment), similarity loss (for pair-wise semantic consistency), and relative similarity distillation loss (for ranking preference). These losses progressively guide a smaller student model, initialized from Stella and incorporating a vision encoder, to learn from multiple teachers (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5). A key aspect is the use of Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) in Stage 3 to reduce the concatenated high-dimensional teacher vectors into more manageable dimensions. Stage 4 focuses on multimodal alignment. The resulting 2B parameter Jasper model achieves performance comparable to 7B models on the MTEB benchmark, significantly outperforming other models in its parameter class.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The methodology employs a multi-stage distillation process using three losses (cosine, similarity, relative similarity) to transfer knowledge from heterogeneous teacher models to a student model.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is used in Stage 3 to effectively reduce the high dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher model vectors.\n*   The 2B parameter Jasper model demonstrates performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, significantly outperforming models with fewer than 2B parameters.\n*   Stage 1 trains only a fully connected layer, while Stage 2 trains the FC layer and the last three encoder layers of the student model, with both stages using the three core distillation losses.",

The methodology focuses on fusing knowledge from heterogeneous teachers, specifically using NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5. The process involves three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (semantic matching from text-pair perspective), and relative similarity distillation loss (leveraging relative ranking). Initially, teacher model vectors are concatenated, leading to high dimensionality, which is then addressed by Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) in Stage 3 for dimension reduction. Stage 4 focuses on unlocking multimodal potential by training a vision encoder. The resulting Jasper model, with 2 billion parameters, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, outperforming other models in its size class. The implementation details include specific hyperparameters and batch sizes for each of the four training stages.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The methodology employs a multi-stage distillation framework with three progressive loss functions (cosine, similarity, relative similarity) to transfer knowledge from multiple SOTA teacher models to a smaller student model.\n*   High dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher vectors is addressed using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) in Stage 3 for effective dimension reduction.\n*   The Jasper model (2B parameters) demonstrates performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, significantly outperforming other models of similar size.\n*   Implementation details include specific hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes) and training setups for each of the four distillation stages.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper proposes a novel multi-stage knowledge distillation framework to train a smaller student embedding model, Jasper, to distill knowledge from multiple larger, state-of-the-art teacher models. To address the challenge of high vector dimensionality arising from concatenating teacher outputs, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed for effective dimension reduction. The distillation process utilizes three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss for absolute representation alignment, similarity loss for text-pair semantic matching, and relative similarity distillation loss for ranking preferences. This multi-stage approach progresses from aligning specific representations to broader semantic and relative comparisons. Stage 1 and 2 focus on distillation, with Stage 1 training only a mapping layer and Stage 2 also training the last three encoder layers. Stage 3 applies MRL and trains all student model parameters for dimension reduction. Stage 4 aims to unlock multimodal potential by training a vision encoder using self-distillation. Jasper, with 2 billion parameters, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, significantly outperforming smaller models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper utilizes a multi-stage distillation framework with three progressive loss functions (cosine, similarity, relative similarity) to learn from multiple teacher models.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is applied in Stage 3 to reduce the high dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher model outputs.\n*   The training involves distinct stages: Stage 1 (FC layer training), Stage 2 (FC + last 3 encoder layers), Stage 3 (MRL for dimension reduction), and Stage 4 (vision encoder self-distillation for multimodal alignment).\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of the distillation methodology.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, developed using a novel multi-stage knowledge distillation framework to fuse knowledge from heterogeneous state-of-the-art teacher models. The methodology focuses on three progressively broader loss functions: cosine loss for absolute representation alignment, similarity loss for semantic matching between text pairs, and relative similarity distillation loss to capture ranking preferences. To address the high dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher vectors (e.g., 4096 + 8192 = 12288), Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed to reduce vector dimensions. Stage 1 and 2 involve distillation with different parameter training (FC layer only vs. FC layer and last three encoder layers). Stage 3 focuses on dimension reduction using MRL, with all student model parameters trained and utilizing similarity losses. Stage 4 aims for multimodal alignment by training a vision encoder using self-distillation. Jasper achieves a 71.54 average score on the MTEB leaderboard, comparable to 7B models and outperforming smaller models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A multi-stage distillation framework uses three loss functions (cosine, similarity, relative similarity) to transfer knowledge from multiple teacher models to a smaller student model.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is used to effectively reduce the high dimensionality of the student model's vectors, which arises from concatenating teacher outputs.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieves competitive performance on the MTEB leaderboard, matching 7B models and surpassing other models with fewer than 2B parameters.\n*   The training involves distinct stages (1&2 for distillation, 3 for dimension reduction, 4 for multimodal alignment) with varying parameter training and loss function applications.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper details a novel multi-stage distillation framework for training smaller embedding models from larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models, addressing challenges of high parameter counts and vector dimensionality in real-world applications. The methodology employs three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (capturing semantic discrepancies from a text-pair perspective), and relative similarity distillation loss (leveraging relative ranking information). This progression from specific to broader constraints helps the student model learn effectively. To manage the high dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher vectors, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized for efficient dimension reduction. The framework includes a four-stage process: initial distillation from two teachers (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella), then dimension reduction using MRL, and finally, unlocking multimodal potential by training a vision encoder via self-distillation. Jasper, the resulting 2B parameter student model, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating the efficacy of this knowledge fusion approach.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The methodology uses a multi-stage distillation process with three specific loss functions (cosine, similarity, and relative similarity) to fuse knowledge from heterogeneous teacher models.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed to effectively reduce the high vector dimensionality that arises from concatenating teacher model outputs.\n*   The Jasper model, a 2B parameter student, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, validating the distillation approach.\n*   The training involves a four-stage process, progressively transferring knowledge and then reducing dimensionality, with a final stage dedicated to multimodal alignment.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces a novel multi-stage knowledge distillation framework designed to fuse knowledge from heterogeneous teacher embedding models into a smaller student model. The methodology employs three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (Lcosine) for absolute representation alignment, similarity loss (Lsim) for text-pair semantic consistency, and relative similarity distillation loss (Lresim) for ranking preference learning. These losses progress from specific to broader constraints, enabling the student model to learn effectively from multiple SOTA teachers. The ground truth vector (tx) is created by concatenating and normalizing the outputs of teacher models, which initially leads to high dimensionality. To address this, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized in Stage 3 to reduce vector dimensionality. The framework also includes a Stage 4 for unlocking multimodal potential through self-distillation for vision-text alignment. The resulting Jasper model, with 2 billion parameters, achieves performance comparable to 7B models on the MTEB leaderboard, significantly outperforming other models of similar size. Implementation details include specific hyperparameters and training setups for each of the four stages.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A multi-stage distillation framework uses cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss to transfer knowledge from multiple teacher models to a student model.\n*   Ground truth vectors are created by concatenating and normalizing outputs from teacher models, necessitating dimension reduction techniques like MRL.\n*   The Jasper student model (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to 7B models on the MTEB benchmark.\n*   The framework includes a four-stage process, with distinct parameter training strategies between Stage 1 (FC layer) and Stage 2 (FC layer + last three encoder layers).\n*   Stage 4 incorporates self-distillation for multimodal (vision-text) alignment.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces a novel multi-stage knowledge distillation framework designed to fuse knowledge from heterogeneous teacher embedding models into a smaller student model. The methodology employs three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (Lcosine) for absolute representation alignment, similarity loss (Lsim) for text-pair semantic consistency, and relative similarity distillation loss (Lresim) for ranking preference learning. These losses progress from specific to broader constraints, enabling the student model to learn effectively from multiple SOTA teachers. The ground truth vector (tx) is created by concatenating and normalizing the outputs of teacher models, which initially leads to high dimensionality. To address this, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized in Stage 3 to reduce vector dimensionality. The framework also includes a Stage 4 for unlocking multimodal potential through self-distillation for vision-text alignment. The resulting Jasper model, with 2 billion parameters, achieves performance comparable to 7B models on the MTEB leaderboard, significantly outperforming other models of similar size. Implementation details include specific hyperparameters and training setups for each of the four stages.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A multi-stage distillation framework uses cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss to transfer knowledge from multiple teacher models to a student model.\n*   Ground truth vectors are created by concatenating and normalizing outputs from teacher models, necessitating dimension reduction techniques like MRL.\n*   The Jasper student model (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to 7B models on the MTEB benchmark.\n*   The framework includes a four-stage process, with distinct parameter training strategies between Stage 1 (FC layer) and Stage 2 (FC layer + last three encoder layers).\n*   Stage 4 incorporates self-distillation for multimodal (vision-text) alignment.",
