Researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and a curated mathematical reasoning dataset to train a 1.5-billion-parameter model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) under strict resource limitations (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24-hour window). The findings reveal that while RL can rapidly improve reasoning capabilities (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%), prolonged training under strict length constraints leads to performance degradation, instability, and even language drift. Experimentation showed that mixing easier and harder problems, along with using cosine rewards to control output length, offered better initial performance and stability. However, longer completion lengths were deemed necessary for extremely complex tasks. Despite these challenges, the approach achieved competitive reasoning performance with minimal data and cost, offering a cost-effective alternative to large-scale methods.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Strict output length constraints can lead to performance degradation, optimization instability, and language drift in small LLMs trained with RL for reasoning tasks, especially with prolonged training.\n*   A mix of easy and hard problems, combined with cosine rewards to manage output length, can improve initial reasoning performance and stabilize training in small LLMs.\n*   For highly complex reasoning tasks, extending output length limits is crucial to prevent premature truncation and fully leverage the model's capabilities.\n*   RL-based fine-tuning can significantly enhance the reasoning abilities of small LLMs with minimal data and cost, providing a viable, resource-efficient alternative to large-scale approaches.\n*   The multilingual nature of base models can introduce language drift, necessitating explicit language control or monolingual pre-filtering for consistent reasoning performance.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the impact of output length constraints on training small LLMs for complex reasoning tasks using reinforcement learning (RL). The researchers found that while small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains within the initial 50-100 training steps, prolonged training under strict length constraints leads to performance degradation. Specifically, Experiment 1 showed that the 4096-token limit, combined with prolonged training, resulted in unstable accuracy, increased completion lengths, and ultimately, language drift and unreadable content, indicating truncation issues. Experiment 2 mitigated some of these problems by mixing easier and harder problems, reducing the maximum completion length to 3584 tokens, which led to improved initial performance and more stable reasoning behavior. However, late-stage instability persisted. Experiment 3 further improved length control with a cosine reward, stabilizing output lengths between 1000 and 3500 tokens, but found that extending length limits is necessary for extremely hard tasks, especially with multilingual base models. Overall, the research demonstrates the efficacy of RL for small LLMs but highlights the critical challenges posed by output length limitations and the need for careful tuning to avoid degradation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Prolonged training of small LLMs under strict output length constraints (e.g., 4096 tokens) leads to performance degradation, unstable accuracy, and phenomena like language drift and unreadable content, suggesting truncation issues.\n*   Experiment 2 reduced the maximum completion length to 3584 tokens and mixed problem difficulties, yielding improved initial performance and more stable reasoning, though long-term stability remained a challenge.\n*   Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to stabilize output lengths between 1000-3500 tokens, demonstrating better training consistency, but confirmed that extending length limits is crucial for highly complex tasks.\n*   The study emphasizes that while RL can boost small LLM reasoning efficiently, output length constraints are a significant factor affecting stability and efficacy, particularly for challenging reasoning tasks.",

The researchers found that while RL can rapidly improve reasoning in small LLMs, prolonged training under strict length constraints leads to performance degradation. Experiment 1 showed that the 4096-token limit, combined with prolonged training beyond 200 steps, resulted in accuracy drops and unstable outputs, including unreadable content and language drift, likely due to the base model's multilingual nature. Experiment 2, by reducing the maximum completion length to 3584 tokens and mixing easy with hard problems, initially improved performance and stabilized behavior, but still faced late-stage instability. Experiment 3 demonstrated that a cosine reward effectively controlled output length, leading to more consistent training, but the 3584-token limit and the multilingual base model still posed challenges for complex reasoning and language purity. The findings suggest that while RL is effective for small LLMs, careful consideration of length constraints, training duration, and base model characteristics is crucial for sustained efficacy.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Prolonged training of small LLMs under strict output length constraints (e.g., 4096 tokens) can lead to performance degradation, instability, and language drift, particularly with multilingual base models.\n*   Reducing maximum completion length (e.g., to 3584 tokens) and incorporating easier problems can improve initial reasoning performance and stabilize training, but long-term stability remains a challenge.\n*   Cosine rewards effectively control output length, enhancing training consistency, but the chosen length limit may still be insufficient for extremely complex reasoning tasks.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) contributes to language drift and complicates monolingual optimization efforts.\n*   The study highlights a trade-off: while RL offers cost-effective reasoning improvements for small LLMs, limitations in training duration and output length can hinder their full potential on complex tasks.",

Experiment 1 demonstrated that while small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 70%) within initial training steps, prolonged training under a 4096-token limit leads to performance degradation, evidenced by accuracy drops and unstable completion lengths. Experiment 2, by mixing easier problems and reducing the maximum completion length to 3584 tokens, showed improved initial performance (AMC23 to 80%) but still faced late-stage instability. Experiment 3 incorporated a cosine reward to better control output length, stabilizing it between 1000-3500 tokens and improving training consistency, though peak accuracy was slightly lower. A key limitation identified was the multilingual nature of the base model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B), which contributed to language drift and non-English outputs after 150-200 steps, even with explicit prompts.

KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Prolonged training of small LLMs under strict length constraints (e.g., 4096 tokens) leads to performance degradation and instability, as seen in Experiment 1.\n*   Reducing the maximum completion length (to 3584 tokens) and mixing easier problems (Experiment 2) initially boosts performance but does not fully resolve long-term stability issues.\n*   Cosine rewards effectively stabilize output lengths, improving training consistency (Experiment 3), but may slightly reduce peak accuracy compared to methods that prioritize raw performance.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model is a significant limitation, causing language drift and non-English outputs, even with explicit instructions.\n*   Limited training duration and insufficient length constraints hinder the full potential of small LLMs on complex reasoning tasks.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the efficacy of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small LLMs, specifically a 1.5-billion-parameter model, under strict computational constraints. The researchers adapted the GRPO algorithm and curated a high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset, achieving rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) with minimal resources ($42 cost, 7,000 samples). However, prolonged training revealed significant challenges. Experiment 1 showed performance degradation after 200 steps due to the 4096-token limit, leading to unstable accuracy, increased completion lengths, and unintelligible outputs. Experiment 2, by mixing easier problems and reducing the length limit to 3584 tokens, improved initial performance but still faced late-stage instability. Experiment 3 employed a cosine reward to control output length, stabilizing it between 1000-3500 tokens and improving consistency, though it slightly lagged in peak performance. A key limitation identified was the multilingual nature of the base model, leading to language drift and the need for explicit language constraints or extended completion lengths for complex tasks. The findings highlight a trade-off between efficiency and reasoning depth, with small, high-quality datasets effectively bootstrapping capabilities but facing over-optimization under strict constraints. Future work should address length constraints and language drift for more robust reasoning.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements with RL and limited high-quality data, but prolonged training under strict length constraints leads to performance degradation and instability.\n*   The 4096-token limit in early experiments contributed to performance degradation, unstable rewards, and unintelligible outputs, indicating truncation issues.\n*   A cosine reward effectively stabilized output lengths, improving training consistency, but extended length limits are necessary for extremely hard tasks, especially with multilingual base models.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) was a limitation, causing language drift and necessitating explicit language constraints or longer completion lengths for optimal reasoning.\n*   RL-based fine-tuning offers a cost-effective and data-efficient alternative for enhancing small LLM reasoning, achieving competitive results with minimal resources, but challenges in optimization stability and length control persist.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the impact of output length constraints and other factors on the stability and efficacy of training small LLMs for complex reasoning tasks using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The researchers adapted the GRPO algorithm and a curated mathematical reasoning dataset to train a 1.5-billion-parameter model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) under strict resource constraints (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24 hours).\n\nExperiments revealed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) within the first 50-100 steps, especially when a mix of easy and hard problems is used and output length is managed. However, prolonged training under strict 4096-token length limits led to performance degradation, optimization instability, and language drift due to the multilingual nature of the base model. The cosine reward was found to stabilize output lengths, improving consistency, but extreme tasks still required longer completion limits. Despite these challenges, the approach demonstrated significant cost-efficiency ($42 vs. thousands for baselines) and competitive performance, highlighting RL's potential for resource-constrained reasoning enhancement.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Strict output length constraints (e.g., 4096 tokens) negatively impact small LLMs trained for complex reasoning, leading to performance degradation and truncation issues after initial gains.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems improves early reasoning performance and stabilizes behavior, but long-term stability under length constraints remains a challenge.\n*   Cosine rewards effectively control output length and improve training consistency, but may sacrifice peak accuracy on extremely difficult tasks where longer completion limits are still necessary.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model contributes to language drift during prolonged training, necessitating explicit language controls or longer output lengths for optimal performance.\n*   RL-based fine-tuning offers a cost-effective alternative to large-scale methods for enhancing small LLM reasoning, achieving competitive results with significantly reduced data and computational resources.",

Researchers adapted the GRPO algorithm and a curated mathematical reasoning dataset to train a 1.5-billion-parameter model under strict resource constraints (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24 hours). Experiments revealed that while small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) with limited high-quality data and within initial training steps (50-100), prolonged training under strict length limits (4096 tokens) leads to performance degradation, optimization instability, and language drift. Mixing easier problems with harder ones under reduced length constraints (3584 tokens) improved initial performance and stabilized behavior, but long-term stability remained an issue. A cosine reward effectively controlled output length, enhancing training consistency, but longer completion lengths were deemed necessary for extremely hard tasks, especially with multilingual base models. The findings highlight that RL is a cost-effective approach for small LLMs, but output length constraints and base model limitations pose significant challenges to sustained efficacy and stability in complex reasoning.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Strict output length constraints (e.g., 4096 tokens) contribute to performance degradation and optimization instability in small LLMs trained with RL for reasoning, particularly after initial rapid gains.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) leads to language drift and non-English outputs in prolonged training, despite attempts to enforce English-only responses.\n*   A cosine reward effectively stabilizes output lengths, improving training consistency, but longer maximum completion lengths are necessary for complex reasoning tasks to avoid premature truncation.\n*   Mixing easier problems with harder ones can enhance initial reasoning performance and stabilize training behavior in small LLMs under RL, but does not fully resolve long-term stability issues related to length constraints.\n*   RL-based fine-tuning offers a cost-effective method for improving small LLMs' reasoning capabilities, achieving competitive performance with significantly less data and computational cost compared to larger models.",

The researchers adapted the GRPO algorithm and a curated mathematical reasoning dataset to train a 1.5-billion-parameter model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) under strict resource limitations (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24 hours). Experiments revealed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) within the first 50-100 training steps. However, prolonged training under a 4096-token limit led to performance degradation, unstable optimization, and language drift due to the multilingual nature of the base model. Reducing the length constraint and incorporating easier problems initially improved stability but did not fully resolve long-term issues. The cosine reward effectively controlled output length, enhancing training consistency, but extending length limits is crucial for highly complex tasks. The findings highlight a trade-off: RL is effective for small LLMs with limited data and cost, but output length constraints and base model multilingualism pose significant challenges to sustained efficacy and stability.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Strict output length constraints (e.g., 4096 tokens) can lead to rapid performance degradation and instability in small LLMs after initial gains during RL training for reasoning tasks.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model contributes to language drift and complicates efforts to enforce consistent output language under prolonged training and length constraints.\n*   A cosine reward function effectively stabilizes output lengths, improving training consistency, but may not be sufficient for extremely complex reasoning tasks that require longer generated outputs.\n*   Mixing easier problems with harder ones can initially improve reasoning stability and reduce completion lengths, but long-term stability remains a challenge under these constraints.\n*   RL-based fine-tuning offers a cost-effective and data-efficient method to enhance reasoning in small LLMs, significantly outperforming larger models in terms of cost and resource usage, despite the identified limitations.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the impact of output length constraints on the stability and efficacy of training small LLMs for complex reasoning tasks using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The researchers adapted the GRPO algorithm and curated a high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset, training a 1.5B parameter model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) under strict computational limits (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24 hours). They found that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) with limited data and cost ($42). However, prolonged training under strict length constraints (4096 tokens, later reduced to 3584) led to performance degradation, instability, and language drift, particularly after 200 steps. Experiment 1 showed degradation due to exceeding length limits. Experiment 2, mixing easy and hard problems with reduced length, improved initial performance but still faced late-stage instability. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to control length, stabilizing outputs but sacrificing peak accuracy, indicating that for very hard tasks, extended length limits are crucial, especially with multilingual base models. Future directions include extending training duration and addressing language drift.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements with RL and limited data/cost, but prolonged training under strict output length constraints (e.g., 4096 tokens) leads to performance degradation and instability.\n*   Mixing easier problems with harder ones can improve initial performance and stabilize reasoning behavior in small LLMs, but long-term stability remains a challenge.\n*   Cosine rewards effectively control output length, enhancing training consistency, but may require longer completion limits for extremely complex tasks and multilingual base models to prevent issues like language drift.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) contributes to language drift and complicates monolingual optimization, especially after extended training.\n*   The study demonstrates a cost-effective approach ($42) for enhancing small LLM reasoning, significantly outperforming larger models in terms of resource utilization.",
