SUMMARY:\nThe progressive constraint strategy in knowledge distillation aims to enhance student model learning by gradually intensifying the guidance from a powerful teacher model. Its core objective is to provide a smoother, more effective learning trajectory, preventing the student from being overwhelmed by the full complexity of the teacher's knowledge too early. Unlike single-stage distillation, which applies the full distillation loss immediately, this progressive approach allows the student model to first establish foundational understanding before confronting more nuanced or stringent teacher signals.\n\nThe constraint intensification mechanism typically involves a scheduled increase in the weight of the distillation loss or the introduction of additional, more complex teacher signals (e.g., intermediate feature matching, attention distributions) over time. This phased approach directly addresses student model challenges such as instability and difficulty in assimilating strong teacher signals during early training. By building competence incrementally, the student model can avoid getting stuck in suboptimal local minima and ultimately achieve better performance.\n\nHowever, this strategy comes with trade-offs. It often introduces increased training complexity due to the need for careful scheduling of constraint intensification and parameter tuning across different stages. Training times might also be extended compared to simpler single-stage methods. Moreover, the benefits might not always justify the added complexity, especially for less challenging tasks or highly capable student architectures.\n\n2.
