      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis article proposes counterfactuals as a powerful formal language to unify and ground diverse intuitions surrounding linear representations across various scientific and engineering domains. It argues that by formulating precise \"what if\" scenarios, counterfactuals provide a testable framework for understanding the internal structure and causal dependencies within these representations. The core mechanism involves defining specific interventions on a representation – for example, altering a particular feature or property – and then observing the resulting changes in its vector space. This process makes implicit assumptions about the representation's functionality explicit and reveals underlying principles governing its behavior. The article demonstrates how this counterfactual approach effectively bridges disparate conceptualizations of linear representations, ranging from cognitive models of semantic space to high-dimensional neural network embeddings. By offering a common, formal language, researchers can articulate, compare, and validate hypotheses about the functional properties, biases, and robustness of these representations in a consistent manner. This formalization is posited to not only enhance interpretability but also provide a systematic methodology for evaluating and improving the theoretical consistency and practical utility of linear representations, fostering a more coherent understanding across previously siloed research areas.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactuals are introduced as a formal language to unify disparate intuitions about linear representations.\n*   They provide a precise, testable framework for understanding internal structure and causal dependencies via \"what if\" scenarios.\n*   The approach grounds intuitions by making implicit assumptions explicit through defining interventions and observing changes in representations.\n*   It connects different conceptualizations of linear representations (e.g., cognitive models, neural embeddings) with a common, formal language.\n*   This formalization enhances interpretability, theoretical consistency, and systematic evaluation of linear representations.",
