To effectively address your query and provide a cohesive overview, the full text of the article is required. My function is to extract and synthesize information *from the provided source material*. Without the specific details, methodologies, experimental results, and discussions presented within the article, it is impossible to identify how self-distillation is specifically described as a mechanism for achieving post-hoc modality alignment. This includes understanding the specific techniques employed, the types of modalities involved, the conditions under which it is applied, its reported efficacy, any comparative analyses, or the particular challenges and benefits highlighted by the authors. Therefore, to proceed with a summary that directly addresses your interest in this topic, please furnish the complete article text.
