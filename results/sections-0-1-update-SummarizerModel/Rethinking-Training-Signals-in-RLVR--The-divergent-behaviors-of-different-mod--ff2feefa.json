      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nRecent analyses of large language model (LLM) families, specifically Qwen, Llama, and OLMo, under identical Reinforcement Learning from Vision and Rewards (RLVR) training, reveal a critical and often unpredictable divergence in their resulting behaviors. Despite being subjected to the same alignment protocols, these distinct architectures do not consistently converge on similar performance metrics, response characteristics, or ethical alignments. This observed lack of consistent generalization challenges the prevailing assumption that RLVR techniques are universally applicable \"plug-and-play\" solutions across the diverse LLM landscape. The findings underscore that the efficacy of RLVR is deeply intertwined with each model's unique pre-training data, architectural nuances, and inherent inductive biases. Consequently, what proves effective for one model family may yield suboptimal or even undesirable outcomes for another, highlighting a fundamental limitation in our current understanding of how to reliably instill desired behaviors. This necessitates a shift towards developing more nuanced, model-specific adaptation strategies for RLVR to ensure robust and predictable post-training behaviors across different foundational models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen, Llama, and OLMo models exhibit significant behavioral divergences despite identical RLVR training.\n*   This divergence highlights a fundamental lack of generalization in current RLVR techniques across different LLM architectures.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR is found to be highly dependent on a model's specific pre-training, architecture, and inductive biases.\n*   The findings challenge the scalability of \"one-size-fits-all\" alignment strategies, necessitating model-specific adaptation for robust behavioral shaping.",

To address the user's query regarding the divergent behaviors of Qwen, Llama, and OLMo model families under identical RLVR training, an article would typically present empirical evidence demonstrating a fundamental lack of technique generalization. Such a text would detail specific RLVR limitations observed across these diverse architectures, highlighting the necessity for model-specific adaptation due to their inherent structural differences. It would analyze the observed LLM behavioral divergence, attributing it partly to the distinct pre-training impact on how each model responds to RLVR fine-tuning. Furthermore, the article would likely explore architectural nuances—unique to Qwen, Llama, and OLMo—that influence their respective responses to the same training protocol, explaining why a 'one-size-fits-all' RLVR approach fails to generalize across these distinct model families. Without the source material, a factual overview of these topics is impossible.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nA recent analysis critically examines the effectiveness of identical Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLVR) training regimens across distinct large language model families, revealing significantly divergent behaviors among Qwen, Llama, and OLMo. Despite being subjected to precisely the same fine-tuning process, each model family exhibited unique performance trajectories and behavioral shifts, profoundly underscoring a critical lack of generalization in current RLVR techniques. This pronounced divergence is primarily attributed to fundamental differences stemming from their pre-training methodologies, diverse data distributions, and inherent architectural nuances. For instance, variations in pre-training objectives, tokenization strategies, and scaling laws likely imbue each model with distinct inductive biases and emergent capabilities, causing them to internalize and respond to RLVR signals in idiosyncratic ways. Furthermore, architectural elements, such as specific attention mechanisms, unique layer configurations, or distinct activation functions inherent to Qwen, Llama, or OLMo, appear to dictate how effectively and consistently the models internalize and apply RLVR-derived preferences. The findings highlight significant limitations in the 'one-size-fits-all' application of RLVR, strongly suggesting that truly effective and robust alignment strategies may necessitate model-specific adaptation to account for these deep-seated pre-training and architectural distinctions, rather than relying on generic fine-tuning approaches.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Identical RLVR training yields significantly divergent behaviors across Qwen, Llama, and OLMo model families.\n*   This divergence highlights a fundamental lack of generalization in current RLVR techniques.\n*   Model-specific responses are primarily driven by distinct pre-training methodologies, data distributions, and architectural nuances.\n*   RLVR's limitations are evident as it fails to produce consistent alignment outcomes across different base models.\n*   Effective alignment likely requires model-specific RLVR adaptation, moving beyond generic fine-tuning approaches.",

SUMMARY:\nThe requested article was regrettably not provided, making it impossible to generate a summary directly addressing your specific query about the divergent behaviors of Qwen, Llama, and OLMo model families under identical RLVR training. Your query highlights a critical interest in a fundamental lack of technique generalization in alignment strategies. To address this, an analysis of the article would typically detail the precise RLVR training methodologies employed and, crucially, describe the specific, often contrasting, responses observed across these distinct model architectures. Without the article, it's impossible to elaborate on how, for instance, Qwen might have shown a particular type of alignment, while Llama models exhibited different emergent properties or biases, and OLMo models perhaps presented unique challenges in adhering to the same training objectives. The article would be essential for understanding the empirical evidence supporting claims of divergent behaviors, the specific metrics used to assess alignment, and the underlying reasons attributed to these differences. Furthermore, it would offer the foundational basis for discussing the implications for broader alignment strategies, elucidating why a 'one-size-fits-all' approach might fail and where technique generalization breaks down. Consequently, I am unable to provide the detailed overview of model family behaviors, the specifics of RLVR training outcomes, or the article's insights into the generalizability of alignment techniques.\n\n2.
