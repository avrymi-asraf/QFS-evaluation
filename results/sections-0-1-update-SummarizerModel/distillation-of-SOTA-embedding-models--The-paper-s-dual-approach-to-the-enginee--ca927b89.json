To address your query regarding \"the paper's dual approach to the engineering problem of embedding dimensionality,\" please provide the full text of the article. Once the article is available, I can analyze its content to identify and elaborate on the two distinct methodologies or perspectives it employs to tackle the complexities and challenges associated with determining and optimizing the dimensionality of embeddings in an engineering context. This would include detailing how these two approaches complement or contrast each other in their theoretical underpinnings, practical implementation strategies, and ultimate impact on system performance or resource utilization.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Article content is missing.\n*   Cannot identify the \"dual approach\" without the text.\n*   Cannot discuss engineering problem context without the text.\n*   Please provide the article for a relevant summary.",
