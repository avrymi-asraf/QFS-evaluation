      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nReinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning of small language models (SLMs) frequently encounters optimization instability and performance degradation due to several interacting factors. A significant issue stems from the SLMs' inherently limited capacity, which makes them highly vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting. During RL updates, crucial pre-trained knowledge can be overwritten, leading to a decline in general language understanding. This challenge is often compounded by the nature of reward signals: they can be sparse, noisy, or poorly aligned with the desired complex language behaviors, providing insufficient or misleading gradients for effective learning. The sensitivity of RL algorithms to hyperparameter choices further contributes to instability; minor adjustments can cause training to diverge, models to collapse into narrow response patterns (mode collapse), or induce severe performance oscillations, particularly within the constrained parameter space of SLMs. Moreover, the critical exploration-exploitation trade-off poses a dilemma; insufficient exploration can trap the model in suboptimal local optima, while excessive exploration can lead to unstable policies and inefficient learning. Conflicting objectives between the initial pre-training and the new RL fine-tuning task also contribute, making it difficult for SLMs to balance fluency with specific task performance. The computational intensity of RL, even for smaller models, can push resource limits, exacerbating training instability and hindering robust optimization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n    *   **Catastrophic Forgetting:** SLMs' limited capacity leads to the loss of valuable pre-trained knowledge during RL fine-tuning.\n    *   **Sparse/Noisy Reward Signals:** Ineffective, sparse, or misaligned rewards provide poor guidance, hindering stable learning.\n    *   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** RL algorithms are highly sensitive to hyperparameters, causing divergent training, mode collapse, or oscillations.\n    *   **Exploration-Exploitation Imbalance:** Poor balance results in suboptimal local optima or unstable policy updates.\n    *   **Conflicting Objectives:** Tension between pre-training and RL fine-tuning goals degrades overall performance and stability.",
