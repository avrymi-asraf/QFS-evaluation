To address your query, an article detailing various augmentation techniques, their computational costs (e.g., generation time, model size requirements), and their impact on downstream task performance (e.g., accuracy improvements vs. resource consumption) would be necessary. Such a summary would typically discuss the balance between data quality/diversity achieved through augmentation and the associated overhead in terms of processing power, storage, and development time. Without the source material, a detailed analysis of these trade-offs cannot be performed.\n\n2.
