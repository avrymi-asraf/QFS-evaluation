      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nEnhancing LLM reasoning capabilities through data augmentation involves distinct approaches, broadly categorized as instance-dimension and sequence-dimension augmentation. Instance-dimension augmentation focuses on increasing the *quantity and diversity* of training or in-context examples. This involves generating more instances of a problem, for example, by paraphrasing questions, back-translating, adding synthetic noise, or varying problem formulations. The goal is to improve the LLM's robustness, generalization, and ability to handle diverse inputs for a given task, essentially teaching it to recognize and solve the *same type* of problem presented in many ways.\n\nIn contrast, sequence-dimension augmentation manipulates the *structure or content within a single input sequence* to guide the LLM's reasoning process. This often involves techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting, adding scratchpads, self-ask, or problem decomposition within the prompt itself. By explicitly providing intermediate steps, rationale, or breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts within the input, sequence-dimension augmentation encourages the LLM to perform more systematic and interpretable reasoning. While instance-dimension augments the dataset's breadth, sequence-dimension augments the depth and clarity of the reasoning path within each example, both serving as powerful tools for improving LLM's reasoning performance, albeit through different mechanisms.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   **Instance-dimension augmentation** increases the number and diversity of *examples* (instances) to enhance LLM robustness and generalization to varied problem formulations.\n*   **Sequence-dimension augmentation** modifies the *internal structure or content of a single input sequence* to guide the LLM's explicit reasoning process (e.g., Chain-of-Thought).\n*   Instance-dimension techniques aim to teach LLMs to solve the *same problem presented differently*, improving data breadth.\n*   Sequence-dimension techniques aim to improve the *depth and clarity of reasoning steps* within a given problem, fostering systematic problem-solving.\n*   Both augmentation types are crucial for LLM reasoning enhancement, addressing different facets of data quality and processing.",

Instance-dimension augmentation focuses on diversifying the surface forms of individual training examples. This involves techniques like paraphrasing, synonym replacement, or back-translation, which generate new input variations for a given problem without changing its core logical structure. The primary goal is to improve the LLM's robustness and generalization, ensuring it can correctly reason despite varied linguistic expressions of the same underlying task.\n\nIn contrast, sequence-dimension augmentation directly intervenes in the LLM's reasoning process by modifying or generating new *reasoning sequences* or problem structures. This can include techniques such as varying chain-of-thought prompts, introducing different scratchpad formats, or reordering the steps within a multi-step reasoning problem. This approach aims to cultivate more flexible and robust reasoning by exposing the LLM to diverse logical paths and problem-solving strategies. While instance-dimension augmentation strengthens the LLM's ability to handle diverse *inputs*, sequence-dimension augmentation directly enhances its capacity for deeper, more adaptable *reasoning* by manipulating the very structure of its thought process. Both are complementary, with instance focusing on input variability and sequence on the reasoning trajectory itself.\n\n2.
