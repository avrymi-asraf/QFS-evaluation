SUMMARY:\nThis paper presents a definitive solution to the pervasive problem of geometric unidentifiability in representation spaces, which has long hindered the reliable extraction of true underlying factors. Geometric unidentifiability arises because diverse latent representations can produce identical observed data through various geometric transformations, rendering the true generative factors ambiguous and preventing unique identification. The core innovation lies in explicitly imposing a causal structure on these latent variables. The proposed Causal Model resolves this by positing that defining directed relationships, typically through a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), fundamentally breaks the inherent geometric symmetries that lead to unidentifiability. This causal imposition acts as a strong, theoretically grounded inductive bias, compelling the learning algorithm to discover representations that are uniquely identifiable up to a permutation and scaling, rather than an arbitrary geometric transformation. The paper critically analyzes non-causal approaches, such as those relying solely on statistical independence or architectural constraints, demonstrating their inherent limitations in fully resolving these deep-seated geometric ambiguities. It introduces specific Quantification Metrics, including novel disentanglement and identifiability scores, to rigorously assess the degree of unique identifiability achieved by the causal framework. Experimental Validation across synthetic and real-world datasets robustly confirms that the proposed model successfully disentangles and uniquely identifies latent factors, aligning precisely with ground-truth causal structures where other methods fail. The broader implications are profound, establishing a principled pathway for building more interpretable and robust AI systems capable of genuine causal discovery and intervention, moving beyond mere correlation in representation learning and addressing a fundamental challenge in unsupervised learning.\n\n2.
