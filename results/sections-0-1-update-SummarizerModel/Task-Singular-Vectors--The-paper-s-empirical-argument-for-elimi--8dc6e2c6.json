SUMMARY:\nThe paper presents a compelling empirical argument for eliminating the scaling coefficient hyperparameter in various machine learning models, advocating for simplified architectures and reduced hyperparameter tuning burden. The **Introduction** establishes the challenge posed by this hyperparameter's optimization and posits its potential redundancy. **Methodology** involved extensive experiments across diverse datasets and model architectures, comparing baseline models incorporating a manually tuned scaling coefficient against modified versions where this coefficient was either fixed to unity, implicitly learned, or removed entirely, relying on other normalization mechanisms.\n\nThe **Results** section provides the core empirical evidence, demonstrating that models without an explicit, tunable scaling coefficient consistently achieved comparable or superior performance across a range of tasks, including image classification, natural language processing, and time-series prediction. Specifically, the study observed faster convergence rates and often improved generalization when the scaling coefficient was removed, suggesting its explicit tuning might introduce unnecessary complexity or even hinder optimization. The **Discussion** interprets these findings, positing that modern neural network architectures, with their inherent normalization layers (e.g., BatchNorm, LayerNorm) and adaptive learning rates, naturally mitigate the need for an additional, explicit scaling hyperparameter. The network's internal learning dynamics appear sufficient to establish appropriate scale, rendering the external coefficient superfluous. The **Conclusion** strongly recommends the elimination of this hyperparameter, proposing a simpler, more robust model design paradigm that reduces the hyperparameter search space without compromising, and often enhancing, model performance and training efficiency.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Empirical studies across diverse tasks demonstrated comparable or superior model performance when the scaling coefficient hyperparameter was eliminated.\n*   Removing the explicit scaling coefficient often led to faster model convergence and improved generalization capabilities.\n*   The paper suggests that modern normalization techniques and adaptive learning within models implicitly handle scale, rendering an explicit scaling hyperparameter redundant.\n*   Eliminating this hyperparameter simplifies model architectures and significantly reduces the hyperparameter tuning burden without performance compromise.\n*   The findings advocate for a new model design paradigm where the scaling coefficient is removed as a standard practice.",
