To generate a cohesive overview addressing your query, please provide the relevant article content. Once the source material is available, I can extract and synthesize the information specifically pertaining to techniques, challenges, and approaches for integrating knowledge from diverse teacher models, ensuring the summary directly addresses the mechanisms and frameworks employed for such fusion.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   No source article was provided.\n*   Cannot extract information on methodologies for fusing knowledge from heterogeneous teacher models without content.\n*   Please provide the article to enable summarization and highlight extraction.",
