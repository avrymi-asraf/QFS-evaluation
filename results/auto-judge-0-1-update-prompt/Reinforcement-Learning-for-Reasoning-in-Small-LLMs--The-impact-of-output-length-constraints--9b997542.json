Trained under strict resource limitations (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24 hours), the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model, adapted with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a curated mathematical reasoning dataset, demonstrated significant early gains. Performance on AMC23 increased from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reached 46.7%, outperforming baselines like o1-preview at a fraction of the cost ($42). However, prolonged training led to instability, accuracy degradation, and language drift, particularly when output length constraints were not effectively managed. The cosine reward function helped stabilize output lengths, but longer extensions were still needed for highly complex problems. These findings highlight RL's efficacy for small LLMs in resource-constrained settings but also reveal critical challenges related to optimization stability and length management for complex reasoning tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements with RL and limited high-quality data within initial training steps (50-100 steps).\n*   Prolonged training under strict output length constraints can lead to performance degradation, instability, and undesirable outputs (e.g., language drift).\n*   The cosine reward function effectively stabilizes output lengths, improving training consistency, but may require longer completion limits for very complex reasoning.\n*   RL-based fine-tuning offers a cost-effective alternative for enhancing small LLM reasoning, achieving competitive results with minimal data and computational resources.\n*   Output length constraints pose a significant challenge to the stability and efficacy of training LLMs for complex reasoning tasks, requiring careful management through reward design or extended limits.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the impact of output length constraints and reinforcement learning (RL) on the reasoning capabilities of small LLMs, specifically a 1.5-billion-parameter model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B). Under strict resource constraints (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24-hour limit), the researchers adapted the GRPO algorithm and curated a high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset. Experiments revealed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains within the first 50-100 training steps, with AMC23 accuracy increasing from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%. However, prolonged training led to performance degradation, optimization instability, and issues with output length control and multilingual drift, especially with the default 4096-token limit. Using a mixed dataset of easy and hard problems and a cosine reward function to manage length proved more effective. The findings highlight that while RL is a cost-effective way to boost reasoning in small LLMs, output length constraints and the base model's characteristics pose significant challenges to sustained efficacy and stability.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 from 63% to 80%) via RL within limited resources (4 GPUs, 24 hours) and a small dataset (7,000 samples), at a low cost ($42).\n*   Prolonged training beyond 100-200 steps under strict output length constraints (e.g., 4096 tokens) leads to performance degradation, optimization instability, and undesirable outputs (e.g., non-English).\n*   A mixed dataset of easy and hard problems, combined with a cosine reward function for length control, improves initial performance and training stability compared to using only hard problems or basic accuracy rewards.\n*   Output length limitations can prematurely truncate reasoning processes for complex tasks, hindering the full potential of small LLMs.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model can introduce language drift, necessitating explicit language controls or longer output limits for consistent, monolingual reasoning.",

The research fine-tuned a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, under strict resource limitations (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24 hours). Three experiments explored different strategies: using high-quality data, balancing easy and hard problems, and employing a cosine reward to control length.\n\nExperiment 1 showed that while small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains with high-quality data, prolonged training under strict length constraints leads to performance degradation and unstable outputs. Experiment 2 demonstrated that mixing easy and hard problems with reduced length limits improves initial performance and stabilizes behavior but still faces long-term stability issues. Experiment 3 confirmed that cosine rewards effectively stabilize output lengths and improve consistency but noted that extended length limits are necessary for extremely difficult tasks, especially with multilingual base models.\n\nOverall, the fine-tuned models achieved competitive reasoning performance, even surpassing larger models on specific benchmarks, at a significantly lower cost and with less data. However, challenges like optimization instability and the impact of length constraints on complex reasoning remain critical considerations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Prolonged training of small LLMs for reasoning under strict output length constraints can lead to performance degradation and instability, with initial gains diminishing after a certain point.\n*   Balancing easy and hard problems in the training data and using cosine rewards to control output length can improve early performance and training stability, but long-term stability and handling extremely complex tasks still pose challenges due to length limitations.\n*   Despite limitations, RL-based fine-tuning enables small LLMs to achieve competitive reasoning capabilities with significantly reduced data and computational costs compared to larger models.\n*   Output length constraints are a critical factor affecting the efficacy and stability of training small LLMs for complex reasoning, often forcing premature truncation of reasoning processes.\n*   Future work should explore extended training durations, adaptive length schedules, and explicit language controls to further mitigate the negative impacts of length constraints and multilingualism on reasoning performance.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the impact of output length constraints on training small LLMs for complex reasoning tasks, specifically using reinforcement learning (RL) on a 1.5-billion-parameter model. The research found that while RL can rapidly improve reasoning capabilities with limited high-quality data (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%), prolonged training under strict length constraints leads to performance degradation and instability. Experiment 1 showed that performance declines after initial gains due to models exceeding token limits. Experiment 2, by mixing easy and hard problems, improved initial performance and stabilized behavior, but long-term stability remained an issue. Experiment 3, using a cosine reward, effectively controlled output lengths, enhancing training consistency but sacrificing peak accuracy, and still struggled with multilingual base model drift. Overall, the approach achieved competitive reasoning performance with minimal resources ($42 cost, 7,000 samples), outperforming larger models on some benchmarks like AIME24. However, limitations include insufficient length for complex tasks, multilingual drift, and the need for more extensive training to overcome instability. Future work could explore longer training, multi-stage length schedules, and language-specific constraints.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) rapidly with RL and limited high-quality data, but prolonged training under strict output length constraints causes performance degradation and instability.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems in the training data improves initial performance and stabilizes reasoning behavior, though long-term stability remains a challenge.\n*   Cosine rewards effectively control output lengths, leading to more consistent training, but may sacrifice peak accuracy and require extended length limits for very complex tasks, especially with multilingual base models.\n*   The studied RL approach offers a cost-effective ($42) and data-efficient (7,000 samples) method for enhancing small LLM reasoning, achieving competitive results against larger models on specific benchmarks like AIME24.\n*   Key limitations identified include insufficient output length for extremely hard problems, unintended language drift from multilingual base models, and the need for more training to fully overcome optimization instability.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the impact of output length constraints on training small LLMs for complex reasoning tasks, specifically using reinforcement learning (RL) on a 1.5B parameter model under strict computational constraints. The research found that while RL can rapidly improve reasoning capabilities (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%), prolonged training under length constraints leads to performance degradation and instability. Experiment 1 showed initial gains followed by decline, highlighting issues with exceeding token limits. Experiment 2, by mixing easy and hard problems with reduced length limits, improved early performance but still faced late-stage instability. Experiment 3, using a cosine reward to control length, stabilized output while maintaining moderate gains. Overall, the approach achieved competitive reasoning performance with minimal data and cost ($42), outperforming similarly sized models and even some 7B models on specific benchmarks like AIME24. However, challenges like the multilingual nature of the base model and insufficient length limits for extremely hard problems persist, suggesting a need for longer training or adaptive length strategies for optimal performance.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   **Rapid Initial Gains, Subsequent Degradation:** Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements with RL within 50-100 steps, but prolonged training under strict length constraints leads to performance degradation and instability.\n*   **Length Constraints Impact Efficacy:** Exceeding maximum completion lengths or having insufficient limits for complex problems hinders the model's ability to fully reason, leading to truncated outputs and performance drops.\n*   **Data Mix and Reward Design Mitigate Issues:** Mixing easy and hard problems improves early stability, and cosine rewards effectively control output length, though peak accuracy might be slightly sacrificed.\n*   **Cost-Effective Reasoning Enhancement:** The RL approach offers a highly cost-effective ($42) and data-efficient method to boost reasoning in small LLMs, achieving competitive results compared to much larger and more expensive models.\n*   **Multilingual Base Models Pose Challenges:** The inherent multilingual nature of the base model can lead to language drift and complicate monolingual optimization, even with explicit instructions.",

The research found that while RL can rapidly improve reasoning capabilities in small LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) with limited data and computational resources, prolonged training under strict length constraints leads to performance degradation and instability. Experiment 1 showed initial gains followed by significant drops after 200 steps due to exceeding length limits. Experiment 2 demonstrated that mixing easy and hard problems improved early performance and stabilized behavior within reduced length constraints, but long-term stability remained an issue. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to better control output length, enhancing training consistency but requiring longer completion lengths for extremely hard tasks. Despite these challenges, the approach proved cost-efficient, achieving competitive performance with minimal resources compared to larger models. The multilingual nature of the base model also posed challenges, leading to language drift and suggesting a need for explicit language controls or longer completion lengths for optimal results.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Prolonged training of small LLMs under strict output length constraints leads to performance degradation and instability.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems, coupled with reduced length constraints, initially enhances reasoning and stabilizes behavior.\n*   Cosine rewards effectively control output length, improving training consistency, but longer completion lengths are necessary for complex tasks.\n*   The study achieved competitive reasoning performance with significantly lower cost and data requirements compared to larger models, highlighting RL's efficiency for small LLMs.\n*   Multilingual base models can introduce language drift, necessitating explicit language constraints or extended output lengths for optimal reasoning performance.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the impact of output length constraints on the stability and efficacy of training small LLMs (1.5 billion parameters) for complex reasoning tasks using reinforcement learning (RL). The researchers adapted the GRPO algorithm and curated a high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset, training on limited hardware (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs) within a 24-hour window. They found that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements with limited data and low cost, with one experiment achieving 80% accuracy on AMC23 and 46.7% on AIME24 for under $42. However, prolonged training under strict length constraints (e.g., 4096 tokens) led to performance degradation, optimization instability, and multilingual outputs. The use of a cosine reward helped stabilize output lengths, but extremely hard tasks still required longer completion limits. The findings suggest that while RL is effective for small LLMs in resource-constrained settings, careful management of length constraints and training duration is crucial for maintaining stability and efficacy.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Training small LLMs (1.5B parameters) with RL can achieve significant reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) with minimal resources and cost ($42).\n*   Prolonged training under strict output length constraints (e.g., 4096 tokens) leads to performance degradation, optimization instability, and multilingual outputs in small LLMs.\n*   A mix of easy and hard problems, combined with a cosine reward to control output length, improved early performance and training stability, but long-term stability remained a challenge.\n*   Extending completion length limits is necessary for extremely hard reasoning tasks, especially when using multilingual base models.\n*   The study highlights a trade-off between training efficiency, reasoning depth, and stability when applying RL to small LLMs under resource constraints.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints. Focusing on a 1.5-billion-parameter model, the research adapted the GRPO algorithm and curated a high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset. Experiment 1 showed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 70%) within 50-100 steps, but prolonged training leads to performance degradation and instability, likely due to length constraints. Experiment 2, by mixing easy and hard problems and reducing maximum completion length, further improved initial performance (AMC23 to 80%) and stabilized behavior, though long-term stability remained an issue. Experiment 3 introduced a cosine reward to control output length, leading to more consistent training and shorter completion lengths, but slightly lower peak performance. Overall, the developed \"Open-RS\" models achieved competitive results, even surpassing o1-preview on AIME24, at a fraction of the cost of larger models, highlighting the efficacy of RL for small LLMs despite challenges with optimization stability and length control.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n* Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements with RL-based fine-tuning and limited high-quality data within the first 50-100 training steps.\n* Prolonged training under strict output length constraints can lead to performance degradation and instability in small LLMs.\n* Mixing easier problems with harder ones and using cosine rewards can help stabilize training and control output length, though extending length limits is crucial for very complex tasks.\n* The proposed RL approach for small LLMs is highly cost-effective and data-efficient, achieving competitive performance with significantly fewer resources compared to larger models.\n* Challenges encountered include optimization instability, the need for careful length constraint management, and potential multilingual drift from the base model.",

The research found that while RL can significantly improve reasoning capabilities with limited high-quality data and resources (achieving competitive performance with minimal cost), prolonged training under strict length constraints leads to performance degradation and instability. Experiment 1 showed rapid initial gains followed by a decline after about 200 steps due to exceeding length limits. Experiment 2, by mixing easy and hard problems and reducing length constraints, improved early performance and stabilized behavior but still faced late-stage instability. Experiment 3, using a cosine reward to control length, improved consistency but highlighted the need for longer completion limits for complex tasks. The overall comparison demonstrated that their approach (Open-RS) achieved competitive results with much lower costs and data usage than larger models, though limitations like multilingual drift and truncation issues remain. Future work could explore extended training, better language control, and hybrid methods to address these challenges and further enhance reasoning in resource-constrained settings.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Strict output length constraints and prolonged training can lead to performance degradation and instability in small LLMs fine-tuned for reasoning.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems along with reduced length constraints can improve early reasoning performance and stabilize behavior, but long-term stability is still a challenge.\n*   Cosine rewards can effectively stabilize output lengths, improving training consistency, but may require longer completion limits for exceptionally difficult problems.\n*   RL-based fine-tuning offers a cost-effective and data-efficient method for enhancing small LLMs' reasoning capabilities, significantly outperforming larger models in terms of cost and data usage.\n*   Limitations include premature truncation of reasoning due to insufficient length limits and potential language drift in multilingual base models, necessitating further research into extended training and language control mechanisms.",
