SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates how a model's inherent latent abilities, such as code reasoning, influence the outcomes of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), even when the reward signal is weak or spurious. The research finds that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance in models like Qwen2.5-Math, even when trained with random, incorrect, or format-based rewards that have little to no correlation with the correct answer. This improvement is attributed to RLVR's ability to surface and upweight pre-existing reasoning strategies learned during pre-training. For instance, Qwen2.5-Math models, which exhibit strong \"code reasoning\" (using Python for mathematical thought without execution), show a marked increase in this behavior after RLVR, leading to substantial accuracy gains. Crucially, these spurious rewards are not effective across different model families (e.g., Llama3, OLMo2), suggesting that the success of RLVR with weak signals is highly dependent on the specific latent abilities present in the base model. The findings imply that RLVR might be less about teaching new reasoning skills and more about eliciting and amplifying existing ones, with the quality and nature of pre-trained latent abilities playing a critical role.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning even with spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format-based) that are not correlated with the correct answer.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, with Qwen2.5-Math models showing substantial gains while other models like Llama3 and OLMo2 do not.\n*   \"Code reasoning\" (using Python for mathematical thought) is identified as a key latent ability in Qwen2.5-Math models that RLVR effectively upweights, leading to performance improvements.\n*   The success of RLVR with weak signals is hypothesized to stem from its ability to elicit and amplify pre-existing reasoning strategies learned during pre-training, rather than teaching new ones.\n*   Researchers should validate RLVR findings on diverse models, not just Qwen variants, as effects can be specific to a model's latent pre-trained capabilities.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and discovers that certain models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, can achieve significant performance improvements even with \"spurious\" or weak reward signals (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, format adherence). This is attributed to RLVR's ability to elicit latent reasoning abilities acquired during pretraining, rather than teaching new skills. A key finding is that Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit strong \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for mathematical thought processes without execution), which is significantly amplified by RLVR, leading to performance gains. This effect is highly model-dependent; other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2 do not show similar improvements with spurious rewards, suggesting their pretraining data and learned behaviors differ. The study highlights that the success of RLVR with weak signals is tied to the model's inherent capabilities, and that findings from one model family may not generalize. This implies that RLVR research should be validated on diverse models, as spurious rewards can easily boost performance on models with specific pretrained latent abilities.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models demonstrate substantial performance gains through RLVR even with weak or incorrect reward signals, suggesting RLVR elicits latent pretrained abilities.\n*   \"Code reasoning\" (generating Python for math without execution) is a prevalent and beneficial pretrained ability in Qwen2.5-Math models, significantly amplified by RLVR.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, failing to generalize to other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2 due to differences in their pretrained latent abilities.\n*   The research emphasizes that RLVR gains, especially with weak rewards, are largely driven by surfacing existing model capabilities rather than teaching new ones.\n*   It is crucial to validate RLVR research across diverse models, as spurious rewards can easily boost performance on models with specific, beneficial pretrained latent skills.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how pre-trained latent abilities, such as code reasoning, influence Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) outcomes, particularly when using \"spurious\" or imperfect reward signals. The study found that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance in models like Qwen2.5-Math, even with rewards that have little to no correlation with the correct answer (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, or format-based rewards). This improvement is largely attributed to RLVR's ability to amplify existing, pre-trained reasoning strategies within the model, rather than teaching new ones. Crucially, these gains are highly model-dependent; spurious rewards that work for Qwen models often fail to benefit other families like Llama or OLMo, suggesting that pre-training data and learned behaviors are key determinants of RLVR effectiveness. The paper highlights \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for mathematical thought processes without execution) as a prominent latent ability in Qwen models that RLVR effectively upweights, leading to significant performance boosts. The study also delves into the mechanisms behind why such weak signals can work, pointing to factors like GRPO's clipping bias, and emphasizes the need for cross-model validation in RLVR research.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can elicit substantial performance gains in mathematical reasoning using even \"spurious\" or weak reward signals, primarily by amplifying pre-existing latent abilities.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, with Qwen models showing significant benefits while other models like Llama and OLMo do not.\n*   \"Code reasoning\" (using Python for mathematical thought) is identified as a key latent ability in Qwen models that RLVR effectively upweights, leading to performance improvements.\n*   Factors like GRPO's clipping bias can create training signals from random rewards by favoring and amplifying existing, high-probability behaviors, which only translate to performance gains if those behaviors correlate with correctness.\n*   The study strongly advocates for validating RLVR findings across diverse model architectures and pre-training backgrounds, as effects observed in one model family do not generalize.",

SUMMARY:\n\nThis research investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with spurious or weak reward signals, focusing on how pretrained latent abilities influence outcomes. Counterintuitively, RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in certain models, like Qwen2.5-Math, even with rewards that have little to no correlation with the correct answer. For instance, using random or incorrect rewards yielded substantial accuracy gains on MATH-500, comparable to using ground truth rewards. However, this phenomenon is highly model-specific; similar spurious rewards failed to benefit other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2. The study identifies \"code reasoning\" – generating Python code to aid mathematical thinking without actual execution – as a distinctive latent ability of Qwen2.5-Math models. RLVR, especially with spurious rewards, significantly increases the frequency of this code reasoning, which directly correlates with improved performance. This suggests RLVR can effectively surface and amplify existing, beneficial reasoning strategies learned during pretraining, even when the reward signal itself is flawed. The paper emphasizes the crucial need for cross-model validation in RLVR research due to these model-specific behaviors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n*   RLVR can achieve significant performance gains in mathematical reasoning even with spurious rewards (e.g., random or incorrect labels), particularly in Qwen2.5-Math models.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; these rewards do not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2.\n*   \"Code reasoning,\" the generation of Python code for mathematical problem-solving without execution, is identified as a strong latent ability in Qwen2.5-Math models that RLVR can effectively elicit and amplify.\n*   The study highlights that RLVR often surfaces and upweights existing, beneficial reasoning patterns learned during pretraining, rather than teaching entirely new capabilities, especially when reward signals are weak.\n*   There is a critical need to validate RLVR findings across diverse model architectures and pretraining distributions, as effects observed in one model family may not apply to others.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how pretrained latent abilities, such as code reasoning, influence the outcomes of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), even with the use of spurious or low-quality reward signals. The study demonstrates that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in models like Qwen2.5-Math, even when trained with rewards that have little to no correlation with the correct answer (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, or format-based rewards). Crucially, these spurious rewards are highly model-dependent, failing to yield similar gains in models like Llama3 or OLMo2. The paper hypothesizes that in the absence of a strong reward signal, RLVR effectively surfaces and upweights latent reasoning abilities acquired during pretraining. For Qwen2.5-Math, \"code reasoning\" (generating code without execution) is identified as a key latent ability that RLVR significantly amplifies, leading to substantial performance improvements. This suggests that the effectiveness of RLVR is not solely dependent on the reward signal's quality but is heavily mediated by the pretrained model's inherent reasoning capabilities.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve significant performance gains in mathematical reasoning even with spurious reward signals (random, incorrect, or format-based) that are poorly correlated with correctness.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, with Qwen2.5-Math models benefiting significantly while other families like Llama3 and OLMo2 show little to no improvement.\n*   Spurious rewards appear to work by eliciting and amplifying latent reasoning abilities learned during pretraining, such as \"code reasoning\" in Qwen2.5-Math.\n*   The GRPO optimization algorithm's clipping bias is identified as a mechanism that can create training signals from random rewards by favoring existing model behaviors.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse models, not just Qwen variants, to understand the generalizability of findings and the role of pretrained latent abilities.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how pretrained latent abilities, specifically code reasoning, influence the outcomes of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), even when the reward signal is weak or spurious. The study demonstrates that models like Qwen2.5-Math can achieve significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning tasks using reward signals that have little to no correlation with the correct answer, such as random rewards or rewards for incorrect labels. This effect is highly model-dependent; these spurious rewards are largely ineffective for other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2. The key finding is that RLVR, especially with spurious rewards, appears to elicit and upweight pre-existing reasoning strategies learned during pretraining. For Qwen2.5-Math, code reasoning—generating Python code to assist in problem-solving without execution—is a prominent latent ability that RLVR significantly increases, leading to improved accuracy. This suggests that the effectiveness of RLVR is not solely determined by the quality of the reward signal but heavily relies on the model's inherent pretrained capabilities. The study also touches upon the GRPO clipping bias mechanism as a potential contributor to how spurious rewards can generate meaningful training signals by favoring existing behaviors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can elicit significant performance gains in models like Qwen2.5-Math even with spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels), largely by amplifying pretrained latent abilities.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; they work for Qwen2.5-Math but generally fail for other families like Llama3 and OLMo2, suggesting pretrained capabilities are crucial.\n*   Code reasoning, a pretrained strategy in Qwen2.5-Math, is significantly upweighted by RLVR (even with spurious rewards), correlating strongly with improved accuracy.\n*   The GRPO algorithm's clipping bias mechanism may explain how random rewards can provide training signals by favoring and exploiting models' existing high-probability behaviors.\n*   The study emphasizes the need to validate RLVR findings across diverse models due to observed model-specific behaviors and the strong influence of pretrained latent abilities.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how pre-trained latent abilities, such as code reasoning, influence reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) outcomes, even when reward signals are weak or spurious. The study demonstrates that models like Qwen2.5-Math can achieve significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning tasks (e.g., MATH-500) using entirely random or incorrect reward signals, achieving performance comparable to ground truth rewards. This effect is largely attributed to RLVR's ability to elicit and upweight pre-existing reasoning strategies within the model, particularly code reasoning in the case of Qwen2.5-Math. Crucially, these gains do not generalize across different model families (e.g., Llama3, OLMo2), suggesting that the effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is highly dependent on the model's pre-training data and inherent reasoning capabilities. The study also touches upon the GRPO clipping bias as a potential mechanism that allows spurious rewards to provide training signals by favoring existing model behaviors. The findings underscore the importance of validating RLVR techniques on diverse models and highlight that pre-trained latent abilities play a significant role in RLVR success, often more so than the quality of the reward signal itself.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can elicit substantial performance improvements in models like Qwen2.5-Math using weak or spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels), often matching gains from ground truth rewards.\n*   The effectiveness of these spurious rewards is highly model-specific, with Qwen2.5 models showing significant gains while other families like Llama3 and OLMo2 do not, indicating a strong reliance on pre-trained latent abilities.\n*   Code reasoning, a pre-existing capability in Qwen2.5-Math models, is significantly upweighted by RLVR (even with spurious rewards), leading to performance gains, and directly inducing this behavior also improves performance.\n*   GRPO's clipping bias is hypothesized to be a mechanism that allows random rewards to provide training signals by exploiting the model's pre-existing high-probability behaviors, which only translates to performance gains if these behaviors correlate with correctness.\n*   The study emphasizes the need for cross-model validation in RLVR research, as effects observed in one model family may not generalize, and suggests that pre-trained latent abilities are key drivers of RLVR success, sometimes more so than the reward signal's quality.",

SUMMARY:\n\nThis paper investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) when using \"spurious\" or weak reward signals, finding that certain models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, can achieve significant performance improvements even with rewards that have little to no correlation with the correct answer. This phenomenon is attributed to RLVR's ability to elicit latent reasoning abilities acquired during pretraining, rather than teaching new ones. The study highlights that \"code reasoning\" – generating code for mathematical thought processes without execution – is a distinctive pretrained ability of Qwen2.5-Math models that is amplified by RLVR, leading to performance gains. Crucially, these improvements are not generalizable to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, suggesting that pretrained latent abilities are a key factor in how models respond to RLVR with weak signals. The paper also explores how optimization algorithms like GRPO, specifically its clipping mechanism, can inadvertently create training signals from random rewards by favoring existing model behaviors. Finally, the research warns that conclusions drawn from Qwen-centric RLVR studies may not hold across diverse models, emphasizing the need for broader model validation.\n\n2.
