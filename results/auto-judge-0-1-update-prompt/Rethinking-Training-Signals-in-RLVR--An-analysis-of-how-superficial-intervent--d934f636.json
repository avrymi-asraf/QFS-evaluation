SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can enhance mathematical reasoning in language models, particularly the Qwen2.5-Math models. Counterintuitively, the study reveals that RLVR can significantly improve performance even when using \"spurious rewards\"â€”signals that are irrelevant or even incorrect with respect to the ground truth answer. For instance, rewards based on random assignments, incorrect labels, or simply correct formatting significantly boosted Qwen2.5-Math performance, sometimes approaching gains from ground truth rewards. This effect, however, is highly model-dependent, with other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2 showing little to no improvement or even degradation with spurious rewards. The paper hypothesizes that RLVR, especially with weak or spurious signals, primarily surfaces and amplifies pre-existing reasoning capabilities learned during pretraining. A key observed behavior in Qwen2.5-Math models is \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid in problem-solving), which RLVR training demonstrably increases, leading to performance gains. This suggests that superficial interventions, like specific reward signals, can elicit complex reasoning behaviors by leveraging and amplifying latent abilities present in the model's pretraining.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can improve mathematical reasoning in models like Qwen2.5-Math even with spurious reward signals (e.g., random, incorrect labels, formatting).\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, with Qwen2.5-Math showing significant gains while other models (Llama3, OLMo2) do not.\n*   RLVR appears to work by eliciting and amplifying pre-existing reasoning capabilities learned during pretraining.\n*   \"Code reasoning\" (using Python code to solve math problems) is a key pre-existing behavior in Qwen2.5-Math models that RLVR training significantly increases, leading to performance improvements.\n*   Superficial interventions like specific reward signals or prompts can elicit complex reasoning behaviors by leveraging these latent model abilities.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness, even with \"spurious\" or weak reward signals, particularly on Qwen2.5-Math models. Counterintuitively, the research demonstrates that these flawed rewards (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, format-following) can elicit significant improvements in mathematical reasoning, sometimes approaching the gains from ground truth rewards. A key finding is that this effect is highly model-dependent; similar spurious rewards fail to improve other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2. The paper hypothesizes that RLVR, especially with weak signals, amplifies pre-existing reasoning capabilities learned during pretraining. For Qwen2.5-Math, this manifests as \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid problem-solving), which is strongly correlated with performance. Explicitly inducing code reasoning also boosts performance, validating this hypothesis. The study also explores the role of GRPO's clipping bias in turning noisy rewards into actionable training signals by favoring pre-existing behaviors. The practical implication is a caution against drawing conclusions from RLVR experiments solely on Qwen models, advocating for broader model validation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards (random, incorrect labels, format-following) significantly improves mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, often rivaling ground truth rewards.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, with other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2 showing minimal or no gains.\n*   RLVR, particularly with weak signals, appears to surface and amplify pre-existing reasoning strategies, such as \"code reasoning\" (using Python for math) in Qwen2.5-Math.\n*   Explicitly prompting or rewarding code reasoning behaviors causally increases performance in Qwen2.5-Math models.\n*   The GRPO optimization algorithm's clipping bias can generate meaningful training signals from noisy rewards by exploiting pre-existing model behaviors, explaining why spurious rewards work on certain models.",

Counterintuitively, the study reveals that RLVR can significantly improve performance even with \"spurious\" rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels, or format-based) on certain models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math. These spurious rewards, which have little to no correlation with the correct answer, can elicit substantial gains, sometimes rivaling those from ground truth rewards. This effect is strongly model-dependent; other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2 do not benefit from these same spurious rewards, often showing minimal improvement or even degradation. The research hypothesizes that RLVR, especially with spurious rewards, surfaces latent reasoning abilities learned during pretraining. A key observation is that Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid problem-solving) at a high frequency, and RLVR training further amplifies this behavior, leading to performance improvements. This suggests that superficial interventions that encourage pre-existing, useful reasoning patterns can be highly effective. The findings also highlight the importance of testing RLVR methods across diverse models and reward types, as conclusions drawn from Qwen models may not generalize.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Spurious rewards (random, incorrect labels, format-based) can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, often matching gains from ground truth rewards.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, with Qwen models benefiting while Llama and OLMo models do not.\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards appears to elicit pre-existing reasoning capabilities, such as \"code reasoning\" (using Python to solve problems), which is prevalent and beneficial in Qwen2.5-Math models.\n*   Directly encouraging code reasoning through prompting or specific rewards also boosts Qwen2.5-Math performance, supporting the hypothesis that RLVR amplifies existing useful behaviors.\n*   The GRPO algorithm's clipping mechanism can introduce a bias that amplifies pre-existing behaviors, providing a training signal even from noisy or random rewards, which is crucial for understanding why spurious rewards work on specific models.",

Counterintuitively, these weak or flawed rewards can significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance in certain models, notably Qwen2.5-Math, often matching gains from ground truth rewards. This improvement is hypothesized to stem from RLVR's ability to elicit latent, pre-trained reasoning capabilities. A key finding is the model-dependent nature of this phenomenon; spurious rewards that benefit Qwen2.5-Math models often fail or even degrade performance in other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, suggesting pre-training data distribution is crucial. The study identifies \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for problem-solving) as a prominent pre-trained behavior in Qwen2.5-Math that RLVR effectively upweights, leading to performance gains. The paper warns that RLVR conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models might not generalize, urging validation across diverse model architectures.\n\n2.  **KEY HIGHLIGHTS:**\n    *   Spurious rewards (random, incorrect labels, format-based) can significantly enhance mathematical reasoning in models like Qwen2.5-Math, often comparable to ground truth rewards.\n    *   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; Qwen2.5-Math benefits significantly, while Llama3 and OLMo2 models show little to no improvement or degradation.\n    *   RLVR appears to elicit latent reasoning capabilities present during pre-training, with \"code reasoning\" (using Python for problem-solving) being a key behavior amplified in Qwen2.5-Math.\n    *   The GRPO optimization algorithm's clipping mechanism might contribute to spurious reward effectiveness by biasing updates towards pre-existing high-probability behaviors, especially in models with strong reasoning priors.\n    *   Researchers are cautioned that RLVR findings on one model family (like Qwen) may not generalize, emphasizing the need for validation on diverse models.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) in enhancing mathematical reasoning, particularly when using \"spurious\" or weak reward signals (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, format adherence). Counterintuitively, these weak signals can significantly improve performance on certain models, notably Qwen2.5-Math, often by eliciting pre-existing reasoning strategies rather than teaching new ones. The research highlights a critical model-dependent generalization issue: what works for Qwen models often fails for others like Llama3 or OLMo2, suggesting that pre-training data and learned behaviors are key. A prominent example is \"code reasoning\" â€“ using Python code to aid mathematical thinking â€“ which Qwen2.5-Math models do frequently and effectively. RLVR, even with spurious rewards, significantly increases the prevalence of this behavior, leading to performance gains. The paper also delves into the GRPO optimization mechanism, proposing that its clipping bias can create training signals from noisy rewards by favoring pre-existing behaviors. A practical warning is issued for RLVR research: conclusions drawn from Qwen models may not generalize, and validation across diverse models is crucial.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Spurious rewards (random, incorrect labels, format) can significantly boost mathematical reasoning performance in models like Qwen2.5-Math, often by surfacing latent reasoning capabilities.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with weak or spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; gains observed in Qwen models do not generalize to others like Llama3 or OLMo2.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit strong \"code reasoning\" (using Python for math), and RLVR, even with spurious rewards, increases this behavior, correlating with performance improvements.\n*   The GRPO optimization algorithm's clipping mechanism may inadvertently create training signals from noisy rewards by favoring pre-existing, high-probability behaviors.\n*   Researchers are cautioned to validate RLVR findings across diverse model families, as results on Qwen models may not be representative.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates how Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can elicit complex reasoning behaviors in language models, even with \"spurious\" or weak reward signals. The study finds that for Qwen2.5-Math models, RLVR training with rewards that are uncorrelated or even negatively correlated with the correct answer (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, or simply rewarding correct formatting) can lead to significant performance improvements on mathematical reasoning tasks. These gains are comparable to those achieved with ground truth rewards.\n\nA key finding is that this phenomenon is highly model-dependent. While Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit substantial improvements with spurious rewards, other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2 show minimal or no gains, suggesting that pre-training data and inherent reasoning strategies play a crucial role. The research identifies \"code reasoning\" â€“ the generation of Python code to aid mathematical problem-solving â€“ as a distinctive behavior in Qwen2.5-Math models that is significantly amplified by RLVR, even with spurious rewards. This amplification of pre-existing, beneficial reasoning patterns is hypothesized to be the mechanism behind the surprising effectiveness of weak or noisy rewards. The paper warns that conclusions drawn from Qwen-centric RLVR research may not generalize and urges validation on diverse models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models using weak or spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format) as effectively as ground truth rewards.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; Qwen2.5-Math models benefit greatly, while Llama3 and OLMo2 models do not, indicating the importance of pre-training.\n*   RLVR amplifies pre-existing reasoning strategies, particularly \"code reasoning\" (using Python for math), in Qwen2.5-Math models, leading to performance gains.\n*   The GRPO optimization algorithm's clipping bias may contribute to this effect by favoring existing high-probability behaviors, even if the rewards are random.\n*   Researchers are cautioned to validate RLVR findings on diverse model families, as conclusions drawn from Qwen models may not generalize.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can elicit complex reasoning behaviors in language models, particularly focusing on the impact of \"spurious\" or weak reward signals. The study demonstrates that even rewards with little to no correlation with the correct answer, such as random rewards or rewards based on output format, can significantly improve mathematical reasoning capabilities in certain models, notably the Qwen2.5-Math family. This improvement is largely attributed to RLVR's ability to surface and amplify pre-existing reasoning patterns learned during pre-training. A key observed behavior in Qwen2.5-Math models is \"code reasoning\" â€“ generating Python code to assist in problem-solving, which strongly correlates with improved accuracy. Crucially, the effectiveness of these spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; other model families like Llama and OLMo show minimal or negative gains, highlighting the importance of pre-training data and inherent model capabilities. The study also delves into the GRPO clipping bias mechanism, suggesting it plays a role in how random rewards can still provide a training signal by favoring existing behaviors. The authors issue a strong warning for future RLVR research to be validated on diverse models, not just Qwen, due to the observed lack of generalization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Spurious rewards (e.g., random, format-based) significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models by leveraging pre-existing reasoning patterns.\n*   \"Code reasoning\" (generating Python for problem-solving) is a key behavior elicited by RLVR in Qwen models, strongly correlating with performance gains.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, with Qwen models showing unique benefits not seen in Llama or OLMo families.\n*   The GRPO algorithm's clipping bias may contribute to how random rewards provide a signal by amplifying existing, high-probability behaviors.\n*   Researchers are cautioned to validate RLVR findings on diverse model architectures and pre-training distributions, as observed effects do not generalize universally.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its surprising effectiveness, even with \"spurious\" or weak reward signals, particularly for Qwen2.5-Math models. The research highlights that RLVR can elicit complex reasoning behaviors by leveraging latent capabilities already present in the pre-trained model, rather than teaching new ones. A key finding is the significant performance boost in Qwen2.5-Math models when trained with rewards that have little to no correlation with the correct answer, such as random rewards, format-following rewards, or even incorrect labels. This effect is strongly model-dependent, with other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2 showing minimal or negative gains under similar spurious reward conditions. The study identifies \"code reasoning\"â€”using Python code to assist in mathematical problem-solvingâ€”as a prominent pre-existing behavior in Qwen2.5-Math models that RLVR effectively upweights, leading to improved accuracy. The paper also delves into the role of GRPO's clipping bias in enabling random rewards to provide training signals by reinforcing existing high-probability behaviors, and warns that conclusions drawn from Qwen-centric RLVR research might not generalize.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve substantial performance gains in mathematical reasoning even with spurious or weak reward signals (e.g., random, format, incorrect labels), particularly for Qwen2.5-Math models.\n*   These gains are largely attributed to RLVR surfacing and upweighting pre-existing reasoning capabilities within the model, such as \"code reasoning\" in Qwen2.5-Math.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2 do not show similar improvements, indicating the importance of pre-training data and learned priors.\n*   GRPO's clipping bias is identified as a mechanism that can create training signals from random rewards by reinforcing the model's dominant pre-existing behaviors, provided those behaviors correlate with correctness.\n*   Researchers are cautioned that findings from Qwen-centric RLVR studies may not generalize, and validation across diverse models and reward types is crucial.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its ability to elicit complex reasoning behaviors in language models, particularly focusing on how superficial interventions can lead to performance gains. The study reveals that for specific models like Qwen2.5-Math, RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning even with \"spurious\" rewards that have little to no correlation with the correct answer, such as random rewards or rewards based on incorrect labels. These spurious rewards achieve performance gains comparable to ground truth rewards. A key finding is that this effect is highly model-dependent; other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2 do not benefit from these spurious rewards. The research identifies \"code reasoning\" â€“ the generation of Python code to aid in mathematical problem-solving â€“ as a distinctive pre-existing behavior in Qwen2.5-Math models. RLVR, even with spurious rewards, substantially increases the frequency of this code reasoning, which is strongly correlated with improved accuracy. The paper demonstrates that directly prompting for or rewarding code reasoning also boosts performance in Qwen2.5-Math, confirming that RLVR can surface and upweight these learned reasoning patterns.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format) can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, achieving gains comparable to ground truth rewards.\n*   This effect is not generalizable; other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2 do not benefit from spurious rewards, highlighting model-specific pretraining as a critical factor.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a pre-existing \"code reasoning\" behavior (generating Python code for problem-solving) which RLVR, even with spurious rewards, substantially increases in frequency, leading to higher accuracy.\n*   Causal testing confirms that explicitly encouraging code reasoning through prompting or RLVR significantly boosts Qwen2.5-Math performance, demonstrating that RLVR can elicit and amplify learned reasoning strategies.\n*   The initial percentage of Qwen2.5-Math-7B responses utilizing code reasoning was 65.0%, which RLVR increased to over 90% even with spurious rewards.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness, particularly with \"spurious\" or weak reward signals, on language models. The research highlights that for certain models, notably Qwen2.5-Math, even random or incorrect rewards can significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance. This improvement is largely attributed to RLVR's ability to surface and upweight pre-existing reasoning capabilities learned during pretraining, rather than teaching new ones. A key observed behavior in Qwen2.5-Math models is \"code reasoning\"â€”using Python code to aid mathematical problem-solving, even without actual execution. RLVR, especially with spurious rewards, dramatically increases the frequency of this code reasoning, leading to substantial performance gains. However, this effect is highly model-dependent; other models like Llama3 and OLMo2 do not show similar improvements with spurious rewards, indicating that the efficacy of RLVR with weak signals is tied to the model's inherent pretraining.

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness, particularly with \"spurious\" or weak reward signals, on language models. The research highlights that for certain models, notably Qwen2.5-Math, even random or incorrect rewards can significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance. This improvement is largely attributed to RLVR's ability to surface and upweight pre-existing reasoning capabilities learned during pretraining, rather than teaching new ones. A key observed behavior in Qwen2.5-Math models is \"code reasoning\"â€”using Python code to aid mathematical problem-solving, even without actual execution. RLVR, especially with spurious rewards, dramatically increases the frequency of this code reasoning, leading to substantial performance gains. However, this effect is highly model-dependent; other models like Llama3 and OLMo2 do not show similar improvements with spurious rewards, indicating that the efficacy of RLVR with weak signals is tied to the model's inherent pretraining. The study also delves into the GRPO algorithm's clipping bias, suggesting it can create training signals from random rewards by favoring pre-existing model behaviors. The findings serve as a practical warning for RLVR research, emphasizing the need to validate results across diverse models and reward types, as observed effects may not generalize.\n\n2.
