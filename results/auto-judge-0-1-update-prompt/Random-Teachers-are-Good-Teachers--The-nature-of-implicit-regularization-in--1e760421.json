SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the implicit regularization induced by teacher-student learning dynamics in self-distillation, specifically by using randomly initialized teachers instead of trained ones. This setup isolates the effects of the learning process itself, removing \"dark knowledge\" from the teacher and data augmentation. Surprisingly, students trained on random teachers still learn meaningful representations, outperforming their teachers in linear probing accuracy. These learned representations are data-dependent and transferable, but degrade with random inputs. The study reveals that the student network develops sparse subnetworks, akin to \"lottery tickets,\" and resides near the boundary of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape. This suggests that self-distillation can leverage implicit regularization for feature learning, and even early-stage supervised training dynamics can occur without explicit labels. Furthermore, initializing the student closely to the teacher amplifies this implicit regularization, highlighting a locality effect in the loss landscape.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students trained with random teachers, devoid of dark knowledge and data augmentation, still learn meaningful representations that surpass their teachers' performance in linear probing.\n*   The learning process implicitly regularizes the student, leading to the development of sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and positioning the student near linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, even without supervised signals.\n*   Initializing the student parameters closely to the random teacher's parameters significantly amplifies the observed implicit regularization and feature learning.\n*   The learned representations are data-dependent and transferable to other tasks, indicating that the implicit dynamics capture generalizable features from the data distribution.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the implicit regularization induced by teacher-student learning dynamics in self-distillation, specifically using random initializations for the teacher model to isolate this effect. The study reveals that even with random, untrained teachers and no data augmentation, students learn meaningful representations that significantly outperform their teachers in terms of probing accuracy. These learned representations are data-dependent and transferable across tasks, but degrade with random inputs. Notably, the student checkpoints exhibit sparse subnetworks (lottery tickets) and reside on the boundaries of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, mirroring early stages of supervised training without requiring label information. The research highlights that initializing the student close to the teacher amplifies this implicit regularization, leading to improved feature learning. This suggests that the success of teacher-student frameworks can be partly attributed to the regularizing nature of their learning dynamics, enabling exploration of the loss landscape without explicit supervision.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the implicit regularization induced by teacher-student dynamics in self-distillation by using randomly initialized teachers instead of trained ones. Surprisingly, students trained on these random teachers exhibit significant improvements in representation quality, outperforming their teachers in linear probing accuracy. These learned representations are data-dependent and transferable to other tasks, but degrade when trained on random inputs. The study reveals that students distilled from random teachers contain sparse subnetworks, akin to \"lottery tickets,\" and reside at the edge of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape. This indicates that self-distillation can leverage implicit regularization from gradient dynamics alone, without relying on \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or data augmentation. The research also highlights that initializing the student closely to the teacher amplifies this implicit regularization effect, potentially due to the presence of asymmetric valleys in the loss landscape.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students trained with random teachers show improved representation quality, outperforming their teachers in linear probing.\n*   These learned representations are data-dependent and transferable, but deteriorate with random inputs, suggesting implicit regularization from data structure.\n*   The student checkpoints exhibit sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and are located at the boundary of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, even without supervised training.\n*   Initializing the student closely to the teacher amplifies the implicit regularization, potentially by exploiting asymmetric valleys in the loss landscape.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the implicit regularization induced by teacher-student dynamics in self-distillation, specifically by using random initializations for the teacher. The core finding is that even without a trained teacher or data augmentation, a student model can learn meaningful representations and even outperform its random teacher. This occurs due to the inherent regularization within the gradient dynamics. The study reveals that representations learned this way are data-dependent and transferable to other tasks. Notably, initializing the student closely to the teacher amplifies this effect, suggesting a beneficial \"locality\" in the loss landscape. Furthermore, the distilled students exhibit properties reminiscent of supervised learning, such as containing sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and residing near linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, indicating that label-independent optimization can mimic early stages of supervised training. This work highlights the power of implicit regularization in teacher-student setups for representation learning.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students trained using random teachers significantly outperform their teachers in representation quality, demonstrating implicit regularization without \"dark knowledge.\"\n*   Learned representations are data-dependent and transferable, even when the teacher is randomly initialized and no data augmentations are used.\n*   Initializing the student model closely to the random teacher amplifies the learning process and improves performance, indicating a beneficial \"locality\" in the loss landscape.\n*   Student models exhibit characteristics of early supervised training, such as containing sparse subnetworks (lottery tickets) and being located near linear basins in the supervised loss landscape.",

By employing randomly initialized teachers instead of trained ones, the researchers isolate the effects of the learning process itself, removing the influence of \"dark knowledge.\" They discover that even with random teachers and without data augmentations, students exhibit significant improvements in representation quality, outperforming their teachers in linear probing accuracy. These learned representations are data-dependent and transferable to new tasks, but degrade with random inputs. Furthermore, the student checkpoints contain sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and reside at the edge of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape. This suggests that self-distillation can leverage implicit regularization for feature learning without explicit supervision or task-specific knowledge, and that early stages of supervised training dynamics can be mimicked by these label-independent processes. The study also highlights that initializing the student closely to the teacher amplifies this implicit regularization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students trained with random teachers significantly outperform their teachers in representation quality, as measured by linear probing accuracy, indicating implicit regularization drives learning.\n*   Learned representations are data-dependent and transferable to new tasks, but fail to develop when trained on random noise, confirming the importance of input data structure.\n*   Student checkpoints exhibit sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and are situated at the boundary of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, mirroring early stages of supervised training without explicit labels.\n*   Initializing the student close to the teacher amplifies the observed implicit regularization effects.",

By using randomly initialized teachers instead of trained ones and removing data augmentations, the authors isolate the regularization inherent in the learning process itself. Their findings reveal that students trained with random teachers exhibit significant improvements in representation quality, as measured by linear probing, often surpassing their teachers. These learned representations are found to be data-dependent and transferable to other tasks, but degrade when trained on random inputs. Crucially, the student checkpoints contain sparse subnetworks, akin to \"lottery tickets,\" and reside near the boundaries of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape. This suggests that label-independent optimization dynamics can mimic early stages of supervised training, exploring the loss landscape without explicit supervision. The study also highlights that initializing students close to the teacher amplifies this implicit regularization, leading to better performance.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students trained with random teachers, stripped of \"dark knowledge\" and augmentations, still learn meaningful representations and outperform their teachers.\n*   The learned representations are data-dependent and transferable, indicating that implicit regularization from teacher-student dynamics captures generalizable features.\n*   Student checkpoints from random teacher distillation exhibit sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and occupy regions near linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, mirroring early stages of supervised training.\n*   Initializing the student close to the random teacher amplifies the implicit regularization effect, leading to improved representation learning.",

The core experiment uses a randomly initialized teacher model instead of a trained one, removing \"dark knowledge\" and data augmentation. Surprisingly, the student model learns meaningful representations and even outperforms its random teacher. These learned representations are data-dependent, transferable to other tasks, and surprisingly, the student checkpoints exhibit sparse subnetworks akin to \"lottery tickets\" and reside at the boundary of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape. This implies that the learning dynamics themselves, independent of explicit labels or data augmentation, can drive feature learning and explore the supervised loss landscape. The study also highlights a \"locality phenomenon,\" where initializing the student close to the teacher amplifies this implicit regularization effect, leading to better performance and generalization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students trained with random teachers significantly outperform their teachers in terms of representation quality, demonstrating implicit regularization without \"dark knowledge\" or data augmentation.\n*   The learned representations are data-dependent and transferable, suggesting that the learning dynamics capture generalizable features.\n*   Student checkpoints from this random teacher distillation exhibit characteristics of the \"lottery ticket hypothesis\" (sparse subnetworks) and are found at the edge of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, implying early-phase supervised learning dynamics are mimicked.\n*   Initializing the student closely to the random teacher (locality phenomenon) amplifies the implicit regularization and leads to improved performance and generalization.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis work investigates the implicit regularization induced by teacher-student learning dynamics in self-distillation, specifically by using random initializations for the teacher. The core finding is that even without \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or data augmentations, students can learn meaningful representations and even surpass their random teachers in terms of probing accuracy. The learned representations are shown to be data-dependent, improving with larger datasets and deteriorating with random inputs. Furthermore, these representations exhibit transferability across different tasks. A key observation is the \"locality phenomenon,\" where initializing the student close to the teacher amplifies this implicit regularization, leading to better performance. The study also reveals that student checkpoints contain sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and reside near the boundary of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, suggesting that random teacher distillation mimics early phases of supervised training without requiring labels. This phenomenon is linked to asymmetric valleys in the loss landscape, offering insights into why proximity to the teacher is beneficial.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students trained with random teachers can learn data-dependent and transferable representations, outperforming their teachers in probing accuracy, even without dark knowledge or data augmentations.\n*   Initializing the student closely to the random teacher (locality phenomenon) amplifies the implicit regularization and improves representation learning.\n*   Student checkpoints exhibit characteristics of \"lottery tickets\" (sparse subnetworks) and are found at the edge of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, mimicking early supervised training.\n*   The learning dynamics are tied to data structure, as performance degrades when trained on random noise, and improves with increased dataset size.\n*   The observed phenomena, including lottery ticket formation and navigation of loss landscape basins, suggest that implicit regularization in teacher-student dynamics can guide learning similarly to early stages of supervised training.",
