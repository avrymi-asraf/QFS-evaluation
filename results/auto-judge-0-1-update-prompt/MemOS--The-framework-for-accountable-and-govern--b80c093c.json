      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nMemOS is presented as a novel operating system for Large Language Models (LLMs) that elevates memory to a first-class, governable resource. It addresses the limitations of current LLMs, which lack structured memory management, leading to issues like poor adaptability to evolving knowledge and inability to maintain long-term states. MemOS unifies three core memory types—parametric (encoded in weights), activation (runtime states like KV-caches), and plaintext (external knowledge)—under a standardized abstraction called the Memory Cube (MemCube). This MemCube facilitates tracking, fusion, and migration of heterogeneous memory, enabling structured and traceable access. MemOS establishes a memory-centric execution framework with strong controllability, adaptability, and evolvability, aiming to support continual adaptation, personalized intelligence, and cross-platform coordination in future intelligent systems. The system's architecture, comprising Interface, Operation, and Infrastructure layers, manages the full memory lifecycle, from parsing and scheduling to governance and storage, ensuring accountable and governed memory operations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   MemOS treats memory as a first-class, schedulable, and governable resource for LLMs, addressing current architectural shortcomings.\n*   It unifies parametric, activation, and plaintext memory types under a standardized \"Memory Cube\" (MemCube) abstraction for unified management.\n*   MemOS provides a framework for accountable and governed memory operations, enabling traceability, access control, and lifecycle management.\n*   The system aims to enhance LLMs' adaptability, long-term reasoning, and ability to evolve through structured memory handling.\n*   MemOS supports memory transformation pathways between types, facilitating dynamic adaptation and efficient resource utilization.",

It elevates memory to a first-class resource, unifying parametric, activation, and plaintext memory types. The core of MemOS is the Memory Cube (MemCube), a standardized abstraction for heterogeneous memory, featuring descriptive metadata, governance attributes (access control, lifespan policies), and behavioral indicators for dynamic adaptation. MemOS employs a three-layer architecture: the Interface Layer for API calls and pipeline operations, the Operation Layer for scheduling and lifecycle management, and the Infrastructure Layer for governance and storage. The system execution involves parsing prompts, scheduling memory via MemScheduler, managing lifecycles with MemLifecycle, and utilizing MemOperator for organization, all within a closed-loop I/O path. Future directions include cross-LLM memory sharing, self-evolving memory units, and a scalable memory marketplace. This framework aims to create continually evolving intelligent agents with long-term memory and behavioral plasticity.\n\n2.

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nMemOS is proposed as an operating system for Large Language Models (LLMs) to address the fundamental lack of unified and structured memory management. It aims to treat memory as a first-class operational resource, enabling LLMs to remember, adapt, and grow. MemOS unifies three core memory types: parametric (encoded in weights), activation (runtime states like KV-caches), and plaintext (external knowledge). The Memory Cube (MemCube) serves as a standardized abstraction for these heterogeneous memory types, encapsulating semantic payload and structured metadata. This metadata includes descriptive information, governance attributes (like access control and lifespan policies), and behavioral indicators that drive memory transformations. These transformations, such as converting frequently accessed plaintext into activation states or distilling stable knowledge into parametric forms, are key to MemOS's evolvability. The system architecture includes an Interface Layer for memory APIs and pipeline operations (e.g., Query-Update-Archive chains), an Operation Layer for scheduling and lifecycle management, and an Infrastructure Layer featuring the MemGovernance module for enforcing policies and ensuring accountability. This framework aims to overcome \"memory silos\" in multi-agent systems by facilitating cross-platform coordination and knowledge reuse. Future work includes developing a Memory Interchange Protocol (MIP) for cross-LLM memory sharing.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   MemOS introduces the Memory Cube (MemCube) as a standardized abstraction for heterogeneous memory types (parametric, activation, plaintext), with metadata for identification, governance, and behavioral indicators.\n*   Memory transformation pathways (e.g., Plaintext -> Activation, Plaintext/Activation -> Parametric) are central to MemOS's goal of enabling LLMs to adapt and evolve their memory.\n*   The MemGovernance module within MemOS's Infrastructure Layer is crucial for enforcing access control, lifecycle policies, and audit trails, ensuring accountable memory operations.\n*   MemOS aims to break down \"memory silos\" in multi-agent systems by enabling interoperability and knowledge reuse, with future plans for a Memory Interchange Protocol (MIP).\n*   MemOS utilizes pipeline-style operation chains at the Interface Layer to manage complex, composable memory workflows, ensuring consistent and traceable operations.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nMemOS is presented as a novel operating system for Large Language Models (LLMs) that treats memory as a first-class, governable resource, moving beyond current limitations of parametric and ephemeral activation memory, as well as the ad-hoc nature of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The framework aims to provide unified mechanisms for the representation, organization, and governance of three core memory types: parametric (knowledge in weights), activation (runtime states), and plaintext (external knowledge). At its core is the Memory Cube (MemCube), a standardized abstraction that facilitates tracking, fusion, and migration of heterogeneous memory across tasks and contexts. MemOS establishes a memory-centric execution framework designed for strong controllability, adaptability, and evolvability, addressing issues like long-term state retention, knowledge evolution, and personalized modeling. This approach is crucial for enabling continual adaptation, personalized intelligence, and cross-platform coordination in next-generation intelligent systems, filling a critical gap in current LLM infrastructure by treating memory as a schedulable and governable entity.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   MemOS is an operating system designed to manage memory as a first-class, governable resource for LLMs.\n*   It unifies three core memory types: parametric, activation, and plaintext, under a standardized abstraction called the Memory Cube (MemCube).\n*   The framework aims to provide controllability, adaptability, and evolvability for LLMs, addressing limitations in long-term memory and knowledge evolution.\n*   MemOS enables structured memory organization, lifecycle management, and cross-type transformation, paving the way for continual learning and personalized intelligence.",

SUMMARY:\nMemOS is an operating system designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) that elevates memory to a first-class resource, aiming to enable continual adaptation and long-term reasoning. It unifies parametric, activation, and plaintext memory types through a standardized abstraction called the Memory Cube (MemCube). MemCube encapsulates memory with descriptive, governance, and behavioral metadata to support tracking, fusion, and migration across tasks and contexts. The MemOS architecture is structured into three layers: the Interface Layer for API access and request parsing, the Operation Layer for memory scheduling and lifecycle management, and the Infrastructure Layer for governance, storage, and cross-platform interoperability. MemOS supports memory transformation pathways, allowing for dynamic evolution between memory types (e.g., Plaintext to Activation). Future directions include cross-LLM memory sharing, self-evolving memory units (MemBlocks), and a scalable memory marketplace for collaborative knowledge transfer. The system's execution flow emphasizes a closed-loop memory I/O path, driven by declarative policies and managed via the MemoryCube.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   MemOS treats memory as a first-class resource, unifying parametric, activation, and plaintext memory types using the Memory Cube (MemCube) abstraction.\n*   MemCube includes descriptive, governance, and behavioral metadata to manage memory's lifecycle, access, and evolution.\n*   The MemOS architecture consists of Interface, Operation, and Infrastructure layers, facilitating structured memory handling, scheduling, and governance.\n*   MemOS enables memory transformation pathways, allowing for dynamic evolution and optimization between different memory types.\n*   Future developments focus on cross-LLM memory sharing, self-evolving memory units, and a memory marketplace.",

It provides a unified framework for managing three core memory types: parametric (knowledge in model weights), activation (transient cognitive states), and plaintext (external retrieved knowledge). The system's core is the Memory Cube (MemCube), a standardized abstraction that unifies heterogeneous memory through a data structure and metadata, enabling tracking, fusion, and migration. MemOS features a three-layer architecture: the Interface Layer for API interaction, the Operation Layer for scheduling and lifecycle management, and the Infrastructure Layer for governance and storage. It supports memory transformation pathways, allowing for dynamic adaptation, such as converting frequently accessed plaintext to activation states or distilling stable knowledge into parametric forms. The system's execution flow follows a closed loop, from input parsing to memory activation, transformation, storage, and reuse, all governed by declarative policies and the MemCube. Future directions include cross-LLM memory sharing, self-evolving memory units, and a scalable memory marketplace, aiming to create continuously evolving intelligent agents.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nMemOS is presented as a memory operating system designed to elevate memory to a first-class resource for Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing limitations in current architectures that lack structured memory handling. It unifies parametric, activation, and plaintext memory types under a standardized abstraction called the Memory Cube (MemCube). The MemCube encapsulates memory with descriptive metadata, governance attributes, and behavioral indicators, enabling tracking, fusion, and migration of heterogeneous memory. MemOS employs a three-layer architecture: the Interface Layer for API interaction, the Operation Layer for scheduling and lifecycle management, and the Infrastructure Layer for governance and storage. Crucially, MemOS facilitates memory transformation pathways, allowing for the conversion of memory between types (e.g., plaintext to activation, or activation to parametric) to optimize efficiency and evolution. Future directions include cross-LLM memory sharing, self-evolving memory units, and a scalable memory marketplace, all aiming to create continuously evolving intelligent agents with long-term memory and behavioral plasticity, crucial for accountable and governed memory in multi-agent systems.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nMemOS is a novel operating system designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) that elevates memory to a first-class resource, enabling accountable and governed memory in multi-agent systems. It unifies three core memory types—Parametric, Activation, and Plaintext—through a standardized abstraction called the Memory Cube (MemCube). The MemCube's metadata includes descriptive information, governance attributes (like access permissions and lifespan policies managed by MemGovernance), and behavioral indicators that facilitate memory transformations. These transformations, such as converting frequently accessed plaintext memory into activation templates or distilling stable knowledge into parametric structures, allow for dynamic adaptation and evolution. MemOS provides a pipeline-style operation chain mechanism within its Interface Layer, utilizing standardized APIs for memory operations, enabling composable workflows and transaction control. Future developments include a Cross-LLM Memory Sharing Protocol (MIP) to ensure consistent semantics and secure exchange across different models, further supporting governed memory in multi-agent contexts.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   MemOS treats memory as a first-class, schedulable, and governable resource for LLMs, crucial for multi-agent systems.\n*   The Memory Cube (MemCube) standardizes heterogeneous memory types (Parametric, Activation, Plaintext) and includes governance attributes managed by modules like MemGovernance for accountability.\n*   MemOS supports memory transformation pathways (e.g., Plaintext $\\Rightarrow$ Activation) driven by behavioral indicators, allowing for adaptive memory evolution.\n*   A pipeline-style operation chain and standardized APIs in the Interface Layer enable structured, traceable, and composable memory operations.\n*   Future work includes developing a Cross-LLM Memory Sharing Protocol (MIP) to facilitate secure and consistent memory exchange between agents.",

SUMMARY:\n\nMemOS is a novel operating system designed to elevate memory to a first-class resource for Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing the limitations of current architectures that treat memory as an afterthought. It provides a unified framework for managing three core memory types: parametric (model weights), activation (runtime states), and plaintext (external knowledge). The core of MemOS is the MemCube, a standardized memory abstraction that unifies heterogeneous memory through structured metadata, enabling tracking, fusion, and migration. This abstraction facilitates memory transformation pathways, allowing for efficient evolution and adaptation. MemOS employs a three-layer architecture: the Interface Layer for API access and request parsing, the Operation Layer for memory scheduling and lifecycle management, and the Infrastructure Layer for governance, storage, and cross-platform interoperability. By addressing \"memory silos,\" MemOS aims to enable continual learning, personalized intelligence, and cross-platform coordination in multi-agent systems. Future work includes developing a Cross-LLM Memory Sharing Protocol (MIP) to foster interoperability.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n*   MemOS treats memory as a first-class, schedulable, and governable resource for LLMs, unifying parametric, activation, and plaintext memory types.\n*   The MemCube abstraction standardizes heterogeneous memory, supporting tracking, fusion, and migration through descriptive metadata, governance attributes, and behavioral indicators.\n*   MemOS features a three-layer architecture (Interface, Operation, Infrastructure) for unified memory lifecycle management, scheduling, and governance, directly addressing \"memory silos.\"\n*   Memory transformation pathways (e.g., Plaintext to Activation, Activation to Parametric) are central to MemOS's design for adaptive and evolving LLM capabilities.\n*   Future developments include a Cross-LLM Memory Sharing Protocol (MIP) to enable interoperability and module reuse across different foundation models.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\n\nMemOS is a novel operating system designed to elevate memory to a first-class resource for Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing the limitations of current architectures that treat memory as an afterthought. It provides a unified framework for managing three core memory types: parametric (model weights), activation (runtime states), and plaintext (external knowledge). The core of MemOS is the MemCube, a standardized memory abstraction that unifies heterogeneous memory through structured metadata, enabling tracking, fusion, and migration. This abstraction facilitates memory transformation pathways, allowing for efficient evolution and adaptation. MemOS employs a three-layer architecture: the Interface Layer for API access and request parsing, the Operation Layer for memory scheduling and lifecycle management, and the Infrastructure Layer for governance, storage, and cross-platform interoperability. By addressing \"memory silos,\" MemOS aims to enable continual learning, personalized intelligence, and cross-platform coordination in multi-agent systems. Future work includes developing a Cross-LLM Memory Sharing Protocol (MIP) to foster interoperability.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n*   MemOS treats memory as a first-class, schedulable, and governable resource for LLMs, unifying parametric, activation, and plaintext memory types.\n*   The MemCube abstraction standardizes heterogeneous memory, supporting tracking, fusion, and migration through descriptive metadata, governance attributes, and behavioral indicators.\n*   MemOS features a three-layer architecture (Interface, Operation, Infrastructure) for unified memory lifecycle management, scheduling, and governance, directly addressing \"memory silos.\"\n*   Memory transformation pathways (e.g., Plaintext to Activation, Activation to Parametric) are central to MemOS's design for adaptive and evolving LLM capabilities.\n*   Future developments include a Cross-LLM Memory Sharing Protocol (MIP) to enable interoperability and module reuse across different foundation models.",
