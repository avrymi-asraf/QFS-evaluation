SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces rStar-Math, a novel approach that enables small language models (SLMs) to achieve state-of-the-art math reasoning capabilities, even surpassing OpenAI's o1 model, without relying on distillation from larger models. The core innovation is a \"deep thinking\" process powered by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), guided by an SLM-based process reward model (PPM). To address the challenge of training these SLMs, rStar-Math employs three key methods. Firstly, a code-augmented Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data synthesis method generates step-by-step verified reasoning trajectories by executing Python code for each step, thus filtering out erroneous intermediate steps. Secondly, a novel PPM training method bypasses the need for precise step-level score annotations. Instead, it leverages Q-values from MCTS rollouts to construct preference pairs, enabling the PPM to reliably distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning steps. Finally, a self-evolution recipe iteratively refines both the policy SLM and the PPM over four rounds, progressively improving their math reasoning abilities by generating higher-quality training data. This self-evolutionary process allows SLMs to master complex math reasoning, achieving impressive results on benchmarks like MATH and AIME.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   rStar-Math enables small language models (SLMs) to achieve state-of-the-art math reasoning by using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided by a process reward model (PPM).\n*   A code-augmented CoT synthesis method filters out erroneous intermediate steps by executing generated Python code.\n*   A novel PPM training method avoids noisy step-level score annotations by using preference pairs derived from MCTS Q-values.\n*   A four-round self-evolution recipe iteratively improves the policy SLM and PPM, allowing SLMs to generate progressively higher-quality training data.\n*   This approach allows SLMs to rival or surpass larger models like OpenAI's o1 on challenging math benchmarks without distillation.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces rStar-Math, a novel approach to enhance the math reasoning capabilities of small language models (SLMs) by employing a self-evolved System 2 deep thinking process. A key innovation is a new method for training process reward models (PPMs) that bypasses the need for noisy, step-level score annotations. Instead, rStar-Math constructs preference pairs for PPM training by leveraging Q-values derived from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts. This method allows the PPM to reliably distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning steps, leading to more effective reward signals. The system also utilizes a code-augmented Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data synthesis method, which verifies reasoning steps through code execution, and a self-evolution recipe where the policy SLM and PPM are iteratively improved over multiple rounds. This approach significantly boosts SLM performance on challenging math benchmarks, even surpassing larger models and achieving state-of-the-art results without relying on distillation from superior LLMs. The ablation study in Table 8 confirms the effectiveness of the PPM over other reward models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   rStar-Math trains process reward models (PPMs) by creating preference pairs from Q-values obtained via MCTS, thus avoiding noisy step-level score annotations.\n*   A code-augmented CoT synthesis method verifies reasoning steps through code execution, improving data quality.\n*   A self-evolution recipe iteratively refines the policy SLM and PPM, enabling SLMs to achieve state-of-the-art math reasoning performance.\n*   The PPM is shown to be crucial for determining the performance limit in System 2 reasoning and outperforms Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) and Q-value score-based Process Reward Models (PQMs).",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces rStar-Math, a novel approach that enables small language models (SLMs) to achieve state-of-the-art math reasoning capabilities, even surpassing leading models like OpenAI's o1, without relying on distillation from larger models. The core innovation lies in its \"deep thinking\" methodology, powered by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). rStar-Math tackles the challenge of training effective process reward models (PRMs) by bypassing the need for noisy, step-level score annotations. Instead, it employs a unique process preference model (PPM) trained on preference pairs derived from MCTS Q-values. This PPM reliably distinguishes between correct and incorrect reasoning steps. The system further utilizes a self-evolution recipe over four rounds, iteratively refining both the policy SLM and the PPM by generating increasingly high-quality, step-by-step verified reasoning trajectories. This method significantly boosts SLMs' math reasoning performance on challenging benchmarks like MATH and AIME, demonstrating the potential for self-improvement and efficient learning without direct human annotation of intermediate steps.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   rStar-Math trains process reward models (PRMs) without requiring noisy step-level score annotations by utilizing a process preference model (PPM).\n*   The PPM is trained using preference pairs derived from MCTS Q-values, effectively distinguishing correct from incorrect reasoning steps.\n*   A self-evolution recipe iteratively improves both the policy SLM and PPM by generating step-by-step verified reasoning trajectories through extensive MCTS.\n*   This approach enables small language models (SLMs) to achieve state-of-the-art math reasoning capabilities, rivaling or exceeding larger models without distillation.\n*   Code-augmented generation within MCTS is used to filter out erroneous intermediate steps, ensuring higher data quality.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces rStar-Math, a novel approach to enhance the math reasoning capabilities of small language models (SLMs) by employing a \"deep thinking\" strategy powered by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). A key innovation is a new method for training process reward models (PPMs) that bypasses the need for noisy, step-level score annotations. Instead, rStar-Math leverages Q-values generated during MCTS rollouts to construct preference pairs for training the PPM, allowing it to reliably distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning steps. The system utilizes a self-evolution recipe over multiple rounds, where the policy SLM and PPM are iteratively improved. This process involves a code-augmented Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data synthesis method that uses Python code execution to verify intermediate reasoning steps, ensuring higher data quality. The self-evolutionary process, combined with the robust PPM, enables SLMs to achieve state-of-the-art math reasoning performance, even surpassing larger models like OpenAI's o1. The paper also highlights that the PPM effectively guides the reasoning process and can identify crucial theorem-application steps, contributing to the overall improvement.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThe article introduces rStar-Math, a novel approach that enables small language models (SLMs) to achieve state-of-the-art math reasoning capabilities without relying on larger models for data distillation. A core innovation is a new method for training process reward models (PPMs) that bypasses the need for noisy, step-level score annotations. Instead, rStar-Math leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with code-augmented Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation to create step-by-step verified reasoning trajectories. Crucially, these trajectories are used to construct preference pairs for training the PPM. This preference-based training method, utilizing pairwise ranking loss, allows the PPM to reliably distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning steps, even when precise Q-values are unavailable. The system then employs a self-evolutionary recipe, iteratively refining both the policy SLM and the PPM over multiple rounds, progressively improving their ability to tackle more complex math problems and generate higher-quality training data. This method successfully elevates SLMs' math reasoning performance to rival or surpass leading models like OpenAI's o1.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   rStar-Math trains process reward models (PPMs) by constructing step-level preference pairs, avoiding the need for direct, noisy step-level score annotations.\n*   The PPM is trained using a pairwise ranking loss derived from Q-values generated by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts, enabling reliable discrimination between correct and incorrect steps.\n*   Code-augmented Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation within MCTS is used to create step-by-step verified reasoning trajectories, filtering out erroneous intermediate steps.\n*   A self-evolutionary recipe iteratively trains and refines both the policy SLM and the PPM, progressively improving their math reasoning capabilities and data generation quality.\n*   This methodology allows small language models (SLMs) to achieve state-of-the-art math reasoning performance comparable to or exceeding larger models like OpenAI's o1.",

This method generates step-by-step verified reasoning trajectories by executing generated Python code, mitigating errors in intermediate steps. Crucially, rStar-Math develops a Process Preference Model (PPM) through a novel training methodology that bypasses noisy, step-level score annotations. Instead, it constructs preference pairs from MCTS-derived Q-values, leading to a more effective reward model. This self-evolutionary recipe, comprising four rounds, iteratively improves both the policy SLM and the PPM, progressively tackling more challenging math problems and ultimately boosting SLMs' math reasoning to unprecedented levels.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   rStar-Math utilizes a code-augmented Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method within MCTS to generate step-by-step verified reasoning trajectories, ensuring correctness of intermediate steps.\n*   A novel Process Preference Model (PPM) is trained by constructing preference pairs from MCTS Q-values, effectively bypassing the need for noisy, direct step-level score annotations.\n*   The system employs a four-round self-evolution recipe, iteratively enhancing both the policy SLM and the PPM to progressively improve math reasoning capabilities.\n*   Experiments demonstrate that rStar-Math significantly boosts SLM performance, achieving state-of-the-art results that rival or surpass larger models like OpenAI's o1.",

SUMMARY:\nThe paper introduces rStar-Math, a novel approach for training small language models (SLMs) in math reasoning that bypasses the need for noisy step-level score annotations. It achieves this through a self-evolved deep thinking process utilizing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). A key innovation is the \"code-augmented CoT data synthesis\" method, which generates step-by-step reasoning trajectories by executing Python code for verification, thereby filtering out erroneous intermediate steps. To address the challenge of reward modeling without precise step-level scores, rStar-Math employs a \"Process Preference Model\" (PPM). The PPM is trained using preference pairs derived from MCTS Q-values, allowing it to distinguish between correct and incorrect steps without requiring exact scores. This methodology is implemented through a four-round \"self-evolution\" recipe where the policy SLM and PPM are iteratively refined, progressively improving the quality of generated data and tackling more complex problems. This self-evolutionary process enables SLMs to achieve state-of-the-art math reasoning capabilities, rivaling or surpassing larger models like OpenAI's o1.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   rStar-Math utilizes a \"code-augmented CoT data synthesis\" method to generate verified reasoning trajectories by executing Python code, bypassing the need for noisy step-level score annotations.\n*   A \"Process Preference Model\" (PPM) is introduced to train reward models effectively, using preference pairs derived from MCTS Q-values instead of direct, precise step-level scores.\n*   The \"self-evolution recipe\" iteratively refines the policy SLM and PPM over multiple rounds, leading to progressively higher quality data and improved math reasoning capabilities in SLMs.\n*   This approach allows small language models to achieve state-of-the-art math reasoning performance, comparable to or exceeding larger models like OpenAI's o1, without relying on distillation from superior models.",

SUMMARY:\nThe article introduces rStar-Math, a novel approach to enhance the math reasoning capabilities of Small Language Models (SLMs) by employing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). A key innovation is the development of a \"process preference model\" (PPM) that bypasses the need for noisy, step-level score annotations typically required for training process reward models. Instead, the PPM is trained using preference pairs derived from Q-values generated by MCTS, enabling it to reliably distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning steps. This method is integrated into a self-evolutionary recipe where the policy SLM and PPM are iteratively improved over four rounds, using a code-augmented Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data synthesis method to generate step-by-step verified reasoning trajectories. This approach allows SLMs to achieve state-of-the-art math reasoning performance, rivaling or surpassing larger models like OpenAI's o1, without relying on distillation from superior models. The ablation study in Table 8 confirms the effectiveness of the PPM over traditional Outcome Reward Models (ORM) and Q-value based Process Reward Models (PQM).\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   rStar-Math trains process reward models using a Process Preference Model (PPM) that leverages preference pairs derived from MCTS-generated Q-values, avoiding noisy step-level score annotations.\n*   A code-augmented CoT synthesis method generates step-by-step verified reasoning trajectories for training, enhancing data quality by retaining only steps with successful Python code execution.\n*   A self-evolution recipe, involving four rounds of iterative improvement of the policy SLM and PPM, significantly boosts reasoning capabilities and data quality.\n*   The PPM is shown to be more effective than ORMs and Q-value based PRMs in improving math reasoning performance, as demonstrated in the ablation study (Table 8).\n*   MCTS is central to the methodology, facilitating deep thinking and generating the necessary data for training both the policy model and the PPM.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces rStar-Math, a novel approach for training small language models (SLMs) to excel at math reasoning using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) without relying on distillation from larger models. A key innovation is a new method for training process reward models (PPMs) that bypasses the need for noisy, step-level score annotations. Instead, it constructs preference pairs for each reasoning step based on Q-values derived from MCTS rollouts. This method leverages the ability of Q-values to reliably distinguish between correct and incorrect steps, even if precise scoring is difficult. The system employs a self-evolutionary recipe over four rounds, iteratively improving both the policy SLM and the PPM by generating higher-quality, step-by-step verified reasoning trajectories. This process allows SLMs to achieve state-of-the-art math reasoning capabilities, rivaling and even surpassing larger models like OpenAI's o1 on challenging benchmarks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   rStar-Math trains SLMs for math reasoning using MCTS, guided by an SLM-based process reward model (PPM).\n*   A novel PPM training method avoids noisy step-level score annotations by constructing preference pairs from MCTS Q-values.\n*   The system utilizes a four-round self-evolution process to iteratively generate high-quality training data and improve model performance.\n*   This approach enables SLMs to achieve state-of-the-art math reasoning, outperforming larger models on benchmarks like MATH and AIME.",
