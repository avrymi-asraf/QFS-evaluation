SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the surprising effectiveness of \"spurious\" and \"weak\" reward signals in Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly with Qwen2.5-Math models. The core finding is that even random or incorrect reward signals can significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance. The study posits that RLVR doesn't necessarily teach new reasoning capabilities but rather elicits latent ones present in the pre-trained model. A key mechanism identified for this elicitation, especially with random rewards, is the clipping mechanism within the GRPO optimization algorithm. This clipping bias systematically favors and amplifies pre-existing behaviors of the model. For Qwen2.5-Math, a prominent pre-existing behavior is \"code reasoning\" (using Python code to aid mathematical thought), which strongly correlates with correctness. The clipping bias, when applied with random rewards, upweights this code reasoning behavior, leading to substantial performance gains. This effect is model-dependent, with other model families like Llama and OLMo failing to show similar improvements because they lack or underutilize such beneficial pre-existing reasoning strategies.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards (random, incorrect) significantly improves math reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models by eliciting pre-existing capabilities.\n*   The GRPO algorithm's clipping mechanism is identified as a key factor that can create a directional training signal from noise by amplifying existing model behaviors.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models' \"code reasoning\" (using Python for thought) is a pre-existing behavior that correlates with correctness and is effectively upweighted by the clipping bias under random rewards.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards and the clipping bias mechanism is highly model-dependent, showing limited gains on models like Llama and OLMo that lack strong code reasoning priors.\n*   This suggests RLVR primarily surfaces and reinforces latent reasoning strategies rather than teaching entirely new ones, with the optimization algorithm's properties playing a crucial role.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its surprising effectiveness even with spurious or noisy reward signals, particularly in Qwen2.5-Math models. The research highlights that RLVR, when applied to Qwen models, can significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance by eliciting latent reasoning strategies learned during pretraining. A key finding is that the GRPO optimization algorithm's clipping mechanism plays a crucial role in creating a directional training signal from pure noise. This clipping bias systematically favors and amplifies pre-existing high-probability behaviors within the model. For Qwen2.5-Math, this translates to an increase in \"code reasoning\" – using Python code to assist in problem-solving, even without actual execution. This code reasoning capability, present in Qwen models due to their pretraining, strongly correlates with correctness and is effectively upweighted by the GRPO clipping bias, leading to performance gains even with random rewards. However, this effect is model-dependent; other model families lacking similar pre-existing reasoning patterns do not benefit from these spurious rewards or the clipping bias.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   GRPO's clipping mechanism is identified as a key artifact that enables the creation of a directional training signal from noisy or random rewards.\n*   This clipping bias amplifies pre-existing, high-probability behaviors within models, effectively exploiting learned priors.\n*   For Qwen2.5-Math models, this amplification specifically targets \"code reasoning\" (using Python for mathematical thought), a latent capability strongly correlated with performance.\n*   RLVR, particularly with spurious rewards and the GRPO clipping bias, acts as a mechanism to elicit and upweight these latent, beneficial reasoning strategies.\n*   The effectiveness of this process is highly model-dependent, with Qwen models benefiting due to their specific pretraining data and inherent code reasoning abilities, while other models do not.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness, particularly with spurious reward signals, on various language models. The core of the user's query lies in understanding how optimization algorithm artifacts, specifically the clipping mechanism in GRPO, contribute to creating a directional training signal from pure noise. The research demonstrates that while spurious rewards (like random or incorrect labels) can significantly improve performance in Qwen2.5-Math models, they fail to generalize to other model families. This divergence is attributed to differences in pretraining, where Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capability (using Python to assist mathematical reasoning). The GRPO clipping mechanism plays a crucial role by acting as an optimization artifact that biases the training towards these pre-existing, high-probability behaviors. When applied with random rewards, the clipping bias effectively concentrates the model's attention on its dominant, pre-trained patterns, including code reasoning, thereby creating a directional signal even from noise. This amplification of existing, often beneficial, reasoning strategies is the key to how spurious rewards achieve gains, and the clipping mechanism is instrumental in this process by favoring these ingrained behaviors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The GRPO clipping mechanism is identified as a key optimization artifact that can generate directional training signals from noisy rewards by biasing the model towards its pre-existing, high-probability behaviors.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capability (using Python for math) which is effectively amplified by RLVR, even with spurious rewards, due to the clipping bias.\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards, particularly random rewards, shows significant performance gains on Qwen2.5-Math models by leveraging this code reasoning, but these gains do not generalize to other model families lacking similar pre-trained reasoning strategies.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is not due to the reward signal's informativeness but rather the optimization algorithm's tendency to exploit pre-existing, dominant behaviors, which the clipping mechanism facilitates.\n*   Pretraining data and the resulting model behaviors are critical determinants of RLVR success, especially when using weak or spurious reward signals.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates how Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can improve mathematical reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs), even with spurious or noisy reward signals. The research focuses on the Qwen2.5-Math models and discovers that optimization algorithm artifacts, particularly the clipping mechanism in GRPO, play a crucial role in generating a directional training signal from what would otherwise be noise. Specifically, the clipping bias in GRPO systematically favors and amplifies pre-existing behaviors within the model. For Qwen2.5-Math models, this often manifests as \"code reasoning\" (using Python to assist in problem-solving), a behavior learned during pretraining that correlates with higher accuracy. Even random rewards, which are essentially pure noise, can lead to significant performance gains when this clipping bias is present, as it directs the model to reinforce its dominant, pre-existing reasoning strategies. This effect is highly model-dependent, with other model families failing to show similar improvements with spurious rewards because they lack these specific pre-existing, high-accuracy reasoning patterns.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The clipping mechanism in GRPO can create a directional training signal from pure noise (e.g., random rewards) by amplifying pre-existing model behaviors.\n*   For Qwen2.5-Math models, this amplified behavior is often \"code reasoning,\" a pre-trained strategy that correlates with higher accuracy and drives performance gains even with spurious rewards.\n*   This phenomenon is highly model-dependent; other LLM families do not benefit from spurious rewards because they lack the specific pre-existing reasoning patterns that GRPO's clipping bias can exploit.\n*   Spurious rewards (like random or incorrect labels) can elicit significant improvements by leveraging the model's pre-trained capabilities and the optimization algorithm's inherent biases, rather than by providing genuinely informative feedback.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\n\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its surprising effectiveness, even with spurious or noisy reward signals, particularly in Qwen2.5-Math models. The research highlights that optimization algorithm artifacts, specifically the clipping mechanism within GRPO, can create a directional training signal from pure noise. When trained with random rewards (effectively noise), GRPO's clipping bias systematically favors and amplifies the model's pre-existing high-probability behaviors. For Qwen2.5-Math models, this translates to an increase in \"code reasoning\" – the generation of Python code to assist in mathematical problem-solving, a strategy already present and correlated with correctness in the base model. This amplification of existing, beneficial behaviors explains why spurious rewards can elicit significant performance gains, while other models lacking such pre-existing strategies do not benefit. The paper emphasizes that the effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, largely due to differences in pre-training and the specific reasoning strategies learned.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n*   GRPO's clipping mechanism is identified as a key artifact that can create a useful training signal from random rewards by biasing the optimization towards pre-existing model behaviors.\n*   Spurious rewards, like random noise, can significantly improve Qwen2.5-Math model performance by amplifying their pre-existing \"code reasoning\" strategy, which correlates with correctness.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; models like Llama and OLMo do not benefit as they lack the specific pre-existing reasoning strategies (e.g., code reasoning) that Qwen models possess.\n*   RLVR, even with noisy rewards, primarily elicits and upweights latent capabilities learned during pre-training, rather than teaching entirely new ones.\n*   The study suggests that RLVR research needs validation across diverse models, not just Qwen variants, as observed gains are not generalizable.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates how reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in language models, even with spurious or noisy reward signals. Specifically, it explores the role of algorithm artifacts like the clipping mechanism in GRPO in generating a directional training signal from pure noise. The research finds that GRPO's clipping bias can indeed create a meaningful training signal from random rewards by systematically favoring a model's pre-trained behaviors. This mechanism explains why spurious rewards are effective for models like Qwen2.5-Math, which possess strong pre-trained reasoning patterns such as code reasoning, but fail for other models that lack these capabilities. The study highlights that RLVR primarily amplifies existing pre-trained capabilities, and the effectiveness of spurious rewards is heavily model-dependent. Code reasoning, in particular, is identified as a key behavior that Qwen2.5-Math models leverage and that RLVR can effectively upweight, leading to significant performance gains even with uninformative rewards.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   GRPO's clipping mechanism can create a directional training signal from random (noisy) rewards by biasing the optimization towards pre-trained behaviors.\n*   Spurious rewards are effective when they elicit pre-existing, beneficial reasoning strategies within a model, such as the \"code reasoning\" observed in Qwen2.5-Math models.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, with Qwen2.5-Math models showing significant gains due to their strong pre-trained code reasoning capabilities, while other models do not benefit.\n*   RLVR generally amplifies existing pre-trained capabilities rather than teaching entirely new ones, making the model's prior knowledge crucial for successful training with weak or spurious signals.\n*   Findings from RLVR experiments, especially with spurious rewards, do not generalize across different model families, underscoring the importance of model-specific pretraining distributions.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can improve language model reasoning, particularly in the context of Qwen2.5-Math models, even when using spurious or noisy reward signals. A key finding is that the GRPO optimization algorithm's clipping mechanism plays a crucial role in transforming these noisy signals into a directional training signal. Specifically, the clipping bias inherent in GRPO systematically favors and amplifies pre-existing, high-probability behaviors within the model. For Qwen2.5-Math models, this often manifests as an increase in \"code reasoning\"—the generation of Python code to aid in mathematical problem-solving. This behavior, which is already present in the pre-trained model, strongly correlates with improved accuracy. The study demonstrates that this effect is model-dependent, with other model families like Llama and OLMo failing to show similar gains with spurious rewards because they lack this beneficial pre-existing reasoning strategy. The research also touches upon the impact of prompts and the generalization of these findings to other RL techniques.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The GRPO optimization algorithm's clipping mechanism can create a directional training signal from random rewards by amplifying pre-existing model behaviors.\n*   For Qwen2.5-Math models, this amplified behavior is often \"code reasoning,\" which strongly correlates with improved mathematical accuracy.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, with Qwen models benefiting due to their pre-existing code reasoning capabilities, while other models do not.\n*   RLVR, even with noisy rewards, appears to elicit latent reasoning strategies rather than teaching entirely new ones.\n*   Prompting can also influence or elicit specific reasoning strategies, similar to how RLVR operates, highlighting the importance of model priors.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly using the GRPO algorithm, can elicit strong mathematical reasoning from language models even with spurious or noisy reward signals. A key finding is that GRPO's clipping mechanism plays a crucial role in generating a directional training signal from random noise. This clipping bias effectively amplifies pre-existing reasoning strategies within the model, rather than learning entirely new ones. For instance, Qwen2.5-Math models, which exhibit strong \"code reasoning\" (using Python to aid mathematical thought), significantly improve when trained with random rewards. This improvement is directly linked to the clipping bias upweighting this code reasoning behavior. The paper highlights that this effect is highly model-dependent, with other models like Llama and OLMo failing to benefit from spurious rewards because they lack similar pre-existing, performance-correlating reasoning strategies. Prompt sensitivity is also noted as a factor influencing model behavior, with even random prompts sometimes boosting performance on Qwen models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   GRPO's clipping mechanism is essential for creating a directional training signal from random rewards, by amplifying pre-existing model behaviors.\n*   Spurious rewards, including random noise, can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in models like Qwen2.5-Math by eliciting pre-trained \"code reasoning\" strategies.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards and the GRPO clipping bias is highly model-dependent, relying on the presence of pre-existing, performance-correlating reasoning patterns.\n*   Models lacking robust, performance-aligned reasoning strategies (e.g., Llama, OLMo) do not benefit from spurious rewards, even with GRPO's clipping bias.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit unusual sensitivity to prompts, with even task-irrelevant prompts sometimes leading to performance gains, suggesting prompt engineering as an alternative elicitation method.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how optimization algorithm artifacts, particularly the clipping mechanism in GRPO, can generate a directional training signal from seemingly pure noise, specifically in the context of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). The study demonstrates that even random or incorrect reward signals can lead to significant performance improvements in mathematical reasoning for certain models, like Qwen2.5-Math. This effect is largely attributed to the clipping bias within GRPO, which tends to amplify pre-existing reasoning strategies learned during pretraining. For Qwen2.5-Math models, \"code reasoning\" (using Python for mathematical thought processes without execution) is identified as a key pre-existing behavior that is amplified by RLVR, even with spurious rewards, leading to increased accuracy. Conversely, models lacking this specific pre-existing capability, such as Llama3 or OLMo2, do not benefit from these spurious rewards. The research also highlights the model-specific nature of RLVR effectiveness and the surprising sensitivity of some models, like Qwen2.5-Math-7B, to prompt variations, including task-irrelevant ones.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   GRPO's clipping mechanism can create a directional training signal from random rewards by amplifying existing model behaviors, rather than from the reward signal's inherent information.\n*   Spurious rewards (random, incorrect, format) yield significant performance gains in Qwen2.5-Math models by eliciting pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capabilities, a pattern not observed in other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is heavily model-dependent, correlating with the presence and quality of specific pre-trained reasoning strategies, such as code reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a notable sensitivity to prompts, with even task-irrelevant \"spurious prompts\" sometimes leading to higher initial performance and influencing RLVR outcomes.\n*   The study emphasizes the need to validate RLVR findings across diverse models, as effects observed in one family (e.g., Qwen) do not reliably generalize.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with spurious reward signals, particularly focusing on the GRPO algorithm and its clipping mechanism. The research demonstrates that even random noise as a reward signal can elicit significant performance gains in mathematical reasoning tasks for specific models, notably Qwen2.5-Math. This effect is attributed to the GRPO clipping bias, which tends to reinforce pre-existing, high-probability behaviors of the model. For Qwen2.5-Math, a key pre-existing behavior that correlates with correctness is \"code reasoning\" – generating Python code to assist in problem-solving. RLVR, even with spurious rewards, effectively upweights this code reasoning, leading to improved accuracy. However, this phenomenon is highly model-dependent; other model families like Llama and OLMo do not exhibit similar gains with spurious rewards, as they lack the same pre-existing, performance-correlated behaviors. The study also highlights the model's sensitivity to prompts, showing that even task-irrelevant prompts can sometimes yield high initial performance, and that the effectiveness of spurious rewards is tied to the model's pretraining data and inherent reasoning strategies.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   GRPO's clipping mechanism can transform random noise into a directional training signal by amplifying pre-existing, high-probability model behaviors.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models benefit significantly from spurious rewards because their pre-existing \"code reasoning\" behavior correlates with task correctness and is effectively upweighted by RLVR.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, with other model families (Llama, OLMo) failing to show similar gains due to a lack of comparable pre-existing, performance-correlated reasoning strategies.\n*   Model sensitivity to prompts can influence initial performance and RLVR trajectories, with even unrelated prompts sometimes leading to gains.\n*   RLVR primarily elicits and amplifies latent capabilities present in the base model rather than teaching new ones, especially when using spurious rewards.",
