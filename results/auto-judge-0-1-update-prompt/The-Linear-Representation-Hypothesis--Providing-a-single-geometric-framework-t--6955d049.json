SUMMARY:\nThis paper proposes a unified geometric framework to formally connect the \"subspace hypothesis\" (where concepts are represented as directions) with practical LLM interpretation and control techniques like linear probing and activation steering. The authors formalize \"linear representation\" using counterfactual pairs of inputs/outputs in both the model's input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces. They demonstrate that the unembedding representation corresponds to measurement (linear probing), while the embedding representation corresponds to intervention (activation steering). A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" defined by the orthogonality of causally separable concepts. This specific inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for the construction of steering vectors from the more easily estimated unembedding representations. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these connections, showing that concept directions derived from counterfactuals act as effective linear probes and can be used to steer model behavior while preserving other concepts. The work emphasizes the crucial role of the inner product choice in making geometric notions meaningful for LLM interpretation and control.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis\" by defining concepts using counterfactual input/output pairs in both embedding and unembedding spaces.\n*   Connects unembedding representations to linear probing (measurement) and embedding representations to activation steering (intervention).\n*   Introduces a \"causal inner product\" that treats causally separable concepts as orthogonal, unifying embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   Demonstrates empirically that concept directions derived from counterfactuals can be used for both probing and steering LLM behavior.",
