Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the training set with more problems, RefAug enriches each existing instance with a \"reflection\" section. This section includes alternative approaches to solving the problem and follow-up reasoning that generalizes or extends the original problem, fostering deeper understanding. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance on standard single-round math QA tasks, achieving a notable accuracy gain. Crucially, RefAug excels in complex reflective reasoning scenarios (like error correction and multi-turn problem-solving) where traditional augmentation methods fall short. The study highlights that RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing techniques, leading to even greater performance improvements when combined. Furthermore, RefAug is shown to be effective in code generation tasks, indicating its broader applicability in problems requiring step-by-step logical reasoning. The research suggests that a balance between practicing new problems and reflecting on existing ones is key to maximizing learning.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by adding \"reflection\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) to training instances, promoting deeper understanding beyond just more data.\n*   RefAug significantly improves performance on both standard single-round math QA and complex reflective reasoning tasks, where traditional data expansion methods are less effective.\n*   The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, leading to synergistic performance gains when combined.\n*   RefAug is also effective in code generation, demonstrating its utility for tasks requiring logical reasoning.\n*   The research emphasizes that reflection is a crucial component for robust mathematical reasoning, complementing the quantity of data.",

Unlike traditional data augmentation that increases the quantity of training examples, RefAug focuses on enriching the quality of existing data by embedding problem reflection within each training instance. This reflection takes the form of \"alternative reasoning\" (presenting different solution methods) and \"follow-up reasoning\" (generalizing or extending the problem). Experiments show that RefAug significantly improves performance on standard single-round math problems, yielding a notable accuracy gain. Crucially, it also substantially enhances LMs' abilities in more complex reflective reasoning scenarios, such as follow-up questions and error correction, where standard augmentation methods fall short. RefAug is also found to be complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to even greater performance gains when combined. The method's effectiveness extends to code generation tasks, demonstrating its broad applicability in problem-solving.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by embedding problem reflection (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data.\n*   RefAug improves performance on standard single-round math problems and significantly boosts capabilities in complex reflective reasoning scenarios.\n*   The method is complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, offering synergistic performance improvements.\n*   RefAug's benefits are not limited to math reasoning, showing effectiveness in code generation tasks as well.\n*   The approach deepens the LM's understanding of mathematical concepts and methodologies, reducing reasoning errors.",

Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the training set with more problem instances, RefAug augments existing instances by appending a \"reflection\" section. This section encourages LMs to engage in deeper understanding through alternative reasoning and follow-up reasoning (abstraction or analogy). Experiments show that RefAug significantly boosts performance on standard single-round math problems, achieving a +7.2 accuracy gain. Crucially, it markedly enhances performance on complex reflective reasoning tasks (like follow-up questions and error correction), where existing augmentation methods often fall short. RefAug is complementary to existing techniques, leading to further gains when combined, and also shows promise in code generation tasks. An ablation study confirms the value of both alternative and follow-up reasoning components. The approach is scalable and demonstrates a reduction in reasoning errors, suggesting a deeper grasp of mathematical concepts.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LM math reasoning by embedding \"reflection\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data, deepening understanding beyond mere answer generation.\n*   RefAug significantly improves performance on both standard single-round math problems (+7.2 accuracy) and complex reflective reasoning tasks, where other augmentation methods are less effective.\n*   The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, leading to synergistic performance gains.\n*   RefAug has demonstrated effectiveness in code generation tasks, indicating its broader applicability beyond pure mathematics.\n*   Ablation studies show that both alternative and follow-up reasoning components contribute positively to the model's performance.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces \"reflective augmentation\" (RefAug), a novel technique designed to enhance language model (LM) performance on mathematical tasks by embedding problem reflection into training data. Unlike traditional data augmentation, which focuses on increasing data quantity through new examples, RefAug targets the sequence dimension by appending a \"reflective section\" to existing training instances. This section comprises alternative reasoning and follow-up reasoning (abstraction or analogy), encouraging deeper understanding beyond rote memorization. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance in standard single-round math reasoning tasks, achieving an average accuracy gain of +7.2 over direct fine-tuning. Crucially, RefAug excels in more complex reflective reasoning scenarios (e.g., follow-up questions, error correction) where conventional augmentation methods falter, showing gains of over +20 in some cases. Furthermore, RefAug is complementary to existing data expansion techniques, yielding synergistic improvements. The method also shows promise in code generation tasks and effectively reduces reasoning errors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LM math reasoning by adding reflective sections (alternative and follow-up reasoning) to training data, promoting deeper understanding.\n*   RefAug significantly improves performance on both standard single-round math problems (+7.2 accuracy gain) and complex reflective reasoning tasks, where it substantially outperforms traditional data expansion.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation methods, leading to further performance gains when combined.\n*   The method demonstrates effectiveness in code generation and helps reduce reasoning errors in LMs, indicating broader applicability.\n*   RefAug's benefits are derived from fostering deeper comprehension rather than simply increasing data quantity, addressing limitations of pure data expansion.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel training technique for language models (LMs) that enhances mathematical reasoning by embedding problem reflection into training instances. Unlike traditional data augmentation, which expands the dataset with more problems, RefAug enriches existing instances with \"alternative reasoning\" (different solution paths) and \"follow-up reasoning\" (generalizations or analogies). The study demonstrates that RefAug significantly improves performance on standard single-round math problems, achieving a +7.2 accuracy gain. Crucially, it also substantially boosts capabilities in complex reflective reasoning scenarios (e.g., error correction, multi-turn problem-solving) where other methods falter. RefAug is complementary to existing data expansion techniques, yielding even greater gains when combined. The quality of the augmented reflective sections, even when generated by strong open-source models like LLaMA-3-70B, influences performance, with GPT-4-turbo generally producing higher-quality data for advanced reasoning. The error analysis indicates that RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors rather than calculation errors, suggesting a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LMs' math reasoning by incorporating alternative and follow-up reasoning into training data, improving performance on both standard and reflective tasks.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data expansion methods (like Q-Aug and A-Aug), leading to synergistic performance gains.\n*   The quality of the data used for reflective augmentation (e.g., generated by GPT-4-turbo vs. LLaMA-3-70B) impacts the model's ability to perform complex reflective reasoning.\n*   RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors, indicating a deeper understanding of mathematical principles rather than just improved calculation accuracy.\n*   The placement of reflective content is crucial; prepending it to the answer (as in augmented Chain-of-Thought) hinders reflective reasoning, while appending it (as in RefAug) facilitates it.",

Unlike traditional data augmentation methods that primarily expand the quantity of training data, RefAug focuses on enriching the quality and depth of understanding for each training instance by embedding reflective reasoning. This is achieved by appending a \"reflection section\" to existing training examples, which includes either alternative approaches to solve the problem or follow-up reasoning that generalizes or extends the problem. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly improves performance on standard single-round math problems, achieving a +7.2 accuracy gain. Crucially, it also substantially boosts performance in more complex, reflective reasoning scenarios (like follow-up questions and error correction) where traditional methods falter. RefAug is shown to be complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to even greater gains when combined. An ablation study confirms the value of both alternative and follow-up reasoning components. Error analysis indicates that RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors, suggesting it fosters a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts. The method is also shown to be stable and scalable.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by embedding problem reflection (alternative/follow-up reasoning) into training data, rather than just increasing data quantity.\n*   RefAug improves performance on standard math tasks by +7.2 accuracy and significantly boosts capabilities in complex reflective reasoning scenarios.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation methods, leading to synergistic performance gains.\n*   The method effectively reduces reasoning errors, indicating a deeper understanding of mathematical principles.\n*   RefAug demonstrates stability, scalability, and minimal impact on inference efficiency.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel technique to enhance language models (LMs) for mathematical reasoning by embedding problem reflection into training instances. Unlike traditional data augmentation that simply increases data quantity, RefAug focuses on the sequence dimension by appending \"alternative reasoning\" and \"follow-up reasoning\" to existing solutions. Experiments show RefAug significantly improves performance on standard single-round math QA tasks, achieving a +7.2 accuracy gain. Crucially, it excels in complex reflective reasoning scenarios (e.g., follow-up questions, error correction) where data expansion methods fall short. RefAug is also complementary to existing augmentation techniques, leading to synergistic performance gains. An ablation study confirms the benefit of both alternative and follow-up reasoning components. The method also proves effective in code generation. Error analysis indicates RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors, suggesting a deeper understanding of mathematical principles. The annotation process using GPT-4-turbo is efficient and stable.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces \"reflective augmentation\" (RefAug), a novel method to enhance language models (LMs) for mathematical reasoning by embedding problem reflection into training instances. Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the dataset size, RefAug focuses on enriching the sequence dimension by appending \"alternative reasoning\" and \"follow-up reasoning\" sections to existing solutions. This approach aims to cultivate a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and problem-solving methodologies, enabling LMs to engage in more complex reflective reasoning beyond standard single-round question-answering. Experiments show that RefAug significantly boosts performance on both standard and reflective math tasks, yielding substantial gains over direct fine-tuning and demonstrating complementary benefits when combined with existing data expansion techniques. The method also proves effective in code generation, highlighting the general applicability of reflection in improving LM performance across various reasoning domains.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) enhances LMs by incorporating \"alternative\" and \"follow-up\" reasoning into training data, promoting deeper mathematical understanding.\n*   RefAug improves performance on both standard single-round math problems and more complex reflective reasoning tasks, where traditional data augmentation methods fall short.\n*   The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to synergistic performance gains.\n*   RefAug shows effectiveness in code generation tasks, indicating its broad applicability for improving LM reasoning.\n*   The method focuses on enriching the reasoning process within existing data points rather than simply increasing the quantity of data.",

Unlike traditional data augmentation methods that simply increase the quantity of training data, RefAug enhances the quality by embedding \"reflection\" into each training instance. This reflection involves presenting alternative solution strategies and follow-up reasoning scenarios (generalizations or analogies). Experiments show that RefAug not only boosts performance on standard single-round math problems but also significantly improves capabilities in more complex reflective reasoning tasks, such as error correction and multi-turn problem-solving, where other augmentation methods fall short. The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to further performance gains. The study also demonstrates RefAug's effectiveness in code generation tasks and its robustness across different model sizes. Notably, the error analysis indicates that RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors, suggesting a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts rather than just improved calculation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by incorporating \"reflection\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data, improving performance beyond simple data quantity increases.\n*   RefAug significantly boosts performance on complex reflective reasoning tasks (e.g., error correction, multi-turn interactions) where traditional data augmentation methods are less effective.\n*   The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, leading to synergistic performance improvements.\n*   Ablation studies confirm that both alternative and follow-up reasoning components contribute to performance gains, with their combination yielding the best results.\n*   RefAug also proves effective in code generation tasks, demonstrating its versatility in improving logical reasoning for structured problem-solving.",

Unlike traditional data augmentation methods that increase the quantity of training instances, RefAug enhances the quality of existing data by embedding problem reflection into each training example. This reflection takes the form of \"alternative reasoning\" (presenting a different solution approach) and \"follow-up reasoning\" (generalizing the problem or applying it to a new context). Experiments show that RefAug significantly boosts LM performance on both standard single-round math problems and more complex reflective reasoning tasks, where existing augmentation methods often fall short. Furthermore, RefAug is complementary to other data expansion techniques, leading to even greater performance gains when combined. The method also proves effective in code generation tasks, suggesting reflection is a crucial capability for LMs across various domains. The quality of the augmented data is high, and the method does not introduce significant contamination to test sets.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) trains LMs by embedding problem reflection (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data, rather than just increasing data quantity.\n*   RefAug enhances performance on both standard math problems and complex reflective reasoning tasks, where traditional augmentation methods are less effective.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, yielding synergistic improvements when combined.\n*   The method is validated on code generation tasks, indicating the broad applicability of incorporating reflection.\n*   RefAug improves reasoning accuracy, particularly by reducing reasoning errors, and does not negatively impact inference efficiency.",

  "final_summary": "2. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces \"reflective augmentation\" (RefAug), a novel fine-tuning technique for language models (LMs) aimed at improving mathematical reasoning. Unlike traditional data augmentation methods that increase the quantity of training instances, RefAug enhances the quality of existing data by embedding problem reflection into each training example. This reflection takes the form of \"alternative reasoning\" (presenting a different solution approach) and \"follow-up reasoning\" (generalizing the problem or applying it to a new context). Experiments show that RefAug significantly boosts LM performance on both standard single-round math problems and more complex reflective reasoning tasks, where existing augmentation methods often fall short. Furthermore, RefAug is complementary to other data expansion techniques, leading to even greater performance gains when combined. The method also proves effective in code generation tasks, suggesting reflection is a crucial capability for LMs across various domains. The quality of the augmented data is high, and the method does not introduce significant contamination to test sets.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) trains LMs by embedding problem reflection (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data, rather than just increasing data quantity.\n*   RefAug enhances performance on both standard math problems and complex reflective reasoning tasks, where traditional augmentation methods are less effective.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, yielding synergistic improvements when combined.\n*   The method is validated on code generation tasks, indicating the broad applicability of incorporating reflection.\n*   RefAug improves reasoning accuracy, particularly by reducing reasoning errors, and does not negatively impact inference efficiency.",
