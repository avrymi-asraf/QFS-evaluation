SUMMARY:\nThis paper critiques the prevalent culture of evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) based on leaderboard scores from public benchmarks, arguing that these high scores often mask an overreliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. The authors introduce the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to systematically distort benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic content. This method detects LLM overfitting by revealing performance degradation when prompts are rephrased, indicating a dependency on memorized patterns. Their experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs showed an average performance drop of 2.15% under modest perturbations, with most models exhibiting statistically significant declines. Notably, larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy tended to be more sensitive to these rephrasings, suggesting they overfit to fixed prompt patterns. The study challenges the community to move beyond leaderboard rankings and prioritize evaluating LLMs for resilience and generalization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper critiques the overemphasis on leaderboard scores in LLM evaluation, arguing they can hide overfitting to dataset-specific surface cues.\n*   A new framework, C-BOD, systematically rephrases benchmark prompts to detect LLM overfitting by measuring performance degradation.\n*   Experiments revealed that a majority of tested LLMs (20 out of 26) showed significant performance drops on rephrased prompts, indicating widespread overfitting.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher initial accuracy were found to be more susceptible to this overfitting, suggesting a correlation between scale/performance and reliance on prompt patterns.\n*   The findings advocate for a shift in LLM evaluation towards prioritizing resilience and generalization over simply achieving high scores on static benchmarks.",
