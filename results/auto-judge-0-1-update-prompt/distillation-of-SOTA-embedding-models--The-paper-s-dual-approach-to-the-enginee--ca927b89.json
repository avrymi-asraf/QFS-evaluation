The authors propose a dual approach centered on knowledge distillation and dimensionality reduction. Their multi-stage distillation framework allows a smaller \"student\" model (Jasper) to learn from multiple larger \"teacher\" models (e.g., NV-Embed-v2, Stella). This distillation is guided by three carefully designed losses: cosine loss for direct representation alignment, similarity loss for pair-wise semantic consistency, and relative similarity distillation loss to capture ranking preferences. To manage the resulting high dimensionality, they integrate Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL), employing additional fully connected layers to generate compressed, lower-dimensional vectors. This combined strategy enables their 2B parameter Jasper model to achieve performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, effectively tackling the engineering problem of embedding dimensionality.\n\n2.  **KEY HIGHLIGHTS:**\n    *   A multi-stage knowledge distillation framework is employed to transfer knowledge from multiple large teacher embedding models to a smaller student model.\n    *   Three distinct loss functions (cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss) are used to guide the distillation process from specific to broader semantic understanding.\n    *   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student embedding model, addressing a key engineering challenge.\n    *   The resulting Jasper model (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to larger 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, demonstrating the efficacy of the dual approach.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Jasper embedding model, a 2 billion parameter model that achieves state-of-the-art performance by distilling knowledge from multiple larger teacher embedding models. The core of their approach involves a novel multi-stage distillation framework. Stages 1 and 2 focus on transferring knowledge from teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5) using three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. These losses progressively align the student model's representations with the teachers' from specific to broader semantic perspectives. Stage 3 addresses the challenge of high vector dimensionality, a common issue with large embedding models, by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). This stage uses additional fully connected layers to compress the student model's output into lower-dimensional vectors, maintaining performance. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by integrating a vision encoder and using a self-distillation mechanism to align image and text embeddings. The resulting Jasper model demonstrates performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, significantly outperforming models with fewer parameters.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a multi-stage distillation process using cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss to learn from multiple teacher models.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized in Stage 3 to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model.\n*   Stage 4 integrates a vision encoder and self-distillation to achieve preliminary multimodal alignment.\n*   The 2B Jasper model achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating a dual approach to embedding dimensionality and performance.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art performance by distilling knowledge from multiple larger teacher models. The core of their approach involves a novel multi-stage distillation framework. Stages 1 and 2 focus on transferring knowledge from teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5) using three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss for direct vector alignment, similarity loss for semantic consistency between text pairs, and relative similarity distillation loss for preserving ranking preferences. Stage 3 addresses the challenge of high vector dimensionality, a common issue with SOTA embedding models, by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers to effectively compress representations. Stage 4 aims to unlock multimodal potential by aligning visual embeddings with textual embeddings using a self-distillation mechanism. Jasper's effectiveness is demonstrated by its No. 3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, achieving scores comparable to 7B parameter models while significantly outperforming other models in its size class.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a multi-stage distillation framework to learn from multiple large teacher embedding models.\n*   Three distinct loss functions (cosine, similarity, and relative similarity) are used to capture different aspects of knowledge transfer.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized in Stage 3 to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the student model's embeddings.\n*   Jasper achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models despite having only 2B parameters, securing a top position on the MTEB leaderboard.\n*   Stage 4 introduces a preliminary multimodal alignment using self-distillation with image-caption data.",

The core of their approach is to distill knowledge from multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher embedding models into a smaller student model. This distillation process utilizes three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (for aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (for consistent semantic judgments), and relative similarity distillation loss (for preserving ranking preferences). The framework is structured into four stages. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from large teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella) using the aforementioned losses, progressively training more parameters of the student model. Stage 3 then employs Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the student model's output vectors, using a subset of the distillation losses. Finally, Stage 4 aims to unlock multimodal capabilities by aligning visual embeddings with textual embeddings through self-distillation. The resulting Jasper model, with 2 billion parameters, achieves performance comparable to 7 billion parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating the efficacy of this dual approach to embedding dimensionality.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance at its scale by employing a novel multi-stage distillation framework. This framework effectively distills knowledge from multiple larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher embedding models. The distillation process utilizes three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (ensuring consistent semantic judgment), and relative similarity distillation loss (leveraging ranking preferences). To address the issue of high vector dimensionality in SOTA models, the researchers incorporate Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to effectively reduce the student model's vector dimensionality. The paper also details a fourth stage focused on unlocking multimodal potential by aligning visual embeddings with textual embeddings. Jasper's performance is demonstrated by its No. 3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, achieving results comparable to 7B parameter models while significantly outperforming smaller models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper utilizes a multi-stage distillation framework with three specific loss functions (cosine, similarity, and relative similarity) to learn from multiple SOTA teacher models.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model.\n*   Stage 4 of the training process focuses on multimodal capabilities by aligning image and text embeddings.\n*   The 2B parameter Jasper model achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, securing the No. 3 rank.",

The core of Jasper's development lies in a dual approach to embedding dimensionality. Firstly, a novel multi-stage distillation framework is employed to transfer knowledge from multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher embedding models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5) to a smaller student model. This distillation process utilizes three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (matching semantic discrepancies from a pair perspective), and relative similarity distillation loss (leveraging ranking preferences). Secondly, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is integrated for effective vector dimensionality reduction. The training involves four stages: initial distillation (Stages 1 & 2) using the three loss functions, dimension reduction (Stage 3) with MRL and self-distillation potential, and a preliminary multimodal alignment (Stage 4). Jasper's success demonstrates the efficacy of this combined distillation and dimensionality reduction strategy.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, and its training methodology, which addresses the challenge of high dimensionality in state-of-the-art embedding models. The core of their approach is a novel multi-stage distillation framework designed to transfer knowledge from multiple larger teacher models. This distillation process utilizes three distinct loss functions: cosine loss for direct vector alignment, similarity loss for capturing semantic relationships between text pairs, and relative similarity distillation loss to enforce ranking preferences. To manage the increased dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher embeddings, they employ Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) in Stage 3, effectively reducing vector dimensions through additional fully connected layers. This stage also explores a self-distillation approach where intermediate student embeddings act as teachers for lower-dimensional outputs. Stage 4 focuses on unlocking multimodal potential by aligning visual and textual embeddings, albeit with preliminary results. The Jasper model, built upon the Stella embedding model, achieves a top-3 ranking on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating performance comparable to 7B parameter models, thereby offering a more efficient yet powerful solution for embedding tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper proposes a four-stage distillation process using cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss to train a smaller student model (Jasper) from multiple larger teacher models.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized in Stage 3 for effective dimension reduction of the student model's embeddings.\n*   A self-distillation approach is explored in Stage 3, where intermediate student embeddings serve as teachers for generating lower-dimensional representations.\n*   Stage 4 aims to imbue multimodal capabilities by aligning visual and textual embeddings, though this aspect is still in its early stages.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of their dual approach to embedding dimensionality.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art performance for its size by employing a novel multi-stage distillation framework. The process begins with Stages 1 & 2, where a smaller student model distills knowledge from multiple larger teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella) using three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. These losses progressively capture absolute, semantic, and relative similarity information. Stage 3 focuses on dimension reduction using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL), creating lower-dimensional vectors from the concatenated teacher outputs. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by aligning visual embeddings with textual embeddings through self-distillation. Implementation details highlight the use of RTX A6000 GPUs and specific training stages with varying batch sizes and learning rates. Jasper achieves an impressive average score of 71.54 across 56 MTEB datasets, comparable to 7B parameter models, and significantly outperforms smaller models.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art performance for its size by distilling knowledge from multiple larger teacher models. The process involves a four-stage distillation framework. Stages 1 and 2 focus on transferring knowledge from teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella) using three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. These losses progressively align student and teacher representations from specific to broader semantic comparisons. Stage 3 addresses the challenge of high vector dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher outputs by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers. This stage also explores self-distillation for dimension reduction, using earlier student model outputs as teachers. Stage 4 aims to unlock multimodal capabilities by aligning image and text embeddings through self-distillation, though this is noted as a preliminary step. Jasper's performance on the MTEB leaderboard is comparable to 7B parameter models, outperforming smaller models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a multi-stage distillation process using cosine, similarity, and relative similarity loss functions to learn from multiple teacher models.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized in Stage 3 for effective vector dimensionality reduction, with an exploration of self-distillation for this purpose.\n*   Stage 4 initiates multimodal alignment via self-distillation, using text embeddings as teachers for image embeddings.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark.",

The core of Jasper's development lies in a novel multi-stage distillation framework designed to imbue a smaller \"student\" model with knowledge from multiple larger \"teacher\" embedding models. This distillation process utilizes three carefully crafted loss functions: cosine loss for aligning absolute representations, similarity loss for matching semantic discrepancies, and relative similarity distillation loss for preserving ranking preferences. To address the challenge of high vector dimensionality common in leading models, Jasper incorporates Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL), enabling effective dimension reduction to more manageable sizes. Stage 4 of the training focuses on unlocking multimodal capabilities by aligning visual and textual embeddings. Jasper's effectiveness is validated by its impressive No. 3 ranking on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating performance comparable to 7 billion parameter models and significantly outperforming other models with fewer than 2 billion parameters.\n\n2.

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art performance for its size. The core of Jasper's development lies in a novel multi-stage distillation framework designed to imbue a smaller \"student\" model with knowledge from multiple larger \"teacher\" embedding models. This distillation process utilizes three carefully crafted loss functions: cosine loss for aligning absolute representations, similarity loss for matching semantic discrepancies, and relative similarity distillation loss for preserving ranking preferences. To address the challenge of high vector dimensionality common in leading models, Jasper incorporates Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL), enabling effective dimension reduction to more manageable sizes. Stage 4 of the training focuses on unlocking multimodal capabilities by aligning visual and textual embeddings. Jasper's effectiveness is validated by its impressive No. 3 ranking on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating performance comparable to 7 billion parameter models and significantly outperforming other models with fewer than 2 billion parameters.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a multi-stage distillation framework to transfer knowledge from multiple large teacher models to a smaller student model using cosine, similarity, and relative similarity losses.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model.\n*   Stage 4 of training focuses on developing multimodal capabilities by aligning visual and textual embeddings.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieved a top-3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, with performance comparable to 7B parameter models.",
