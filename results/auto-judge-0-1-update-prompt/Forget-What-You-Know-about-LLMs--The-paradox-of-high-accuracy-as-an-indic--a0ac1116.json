SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a novel framework designed to expose how Large Language Models (LLMs) over-rely on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. The core of C-BOD involves systematically distorting benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic meaning and correct answers. By evaluating LLMs on both original and rephrased prompts, the framework detects significant performance drops, indicating overfitting. The study found that higher baseline accuracy in LLMs often correlates with a greater performance degradation under these perturbations. This highlights a paradox where models excelling on standard benchmarks might be fragile due to their reliance on specific phrasing. Larger LLMs also tended to be more sensitive to these rephrasings. The research challenges the community to move beyond superficial leaderboard scores and prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation, suggesting that models with high accuracy might paradoxically be more fragile.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   High accuracy on standard benchmarks can be a misleading indicator of LLM robustness, as models may overfit to dataset-specific surface cues.\n*   LLMs with higher baseline accuracy tend to exhibit larger performance drops when faced with rephrased prompts, revealing a paradox of accuracy and fragility.\n*   Larger LLMs are generally more sensitive to prompt rephrasing, indicating a greater reliance on fixed prompt patterns.\n*   The C-BOD framework systematically distorts prompts to expose this overfitting, finding that 20 out of 26 evaluated LLMs showed statistically significant performance degradation.\n*   The findings encourage a shift in LLM evaluation towards prioritizing resilience and generalization over raw benchmark scores.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a novel meta-evaluation framework designed to identify how heavily Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on dataset-specific surface cues rather than genuine language understanding. C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic content, exposing LLMs that have overfitted to specific phrasing. The study found that a significant majority of evaluated LLMs (20 out of 26) exhibit performance degradation when faced with these rephrased prompts, indicating a widespread issue of overreliance on memorized patterns. Notably, the research reveals a paradox: models with higher baseline accuracy on original benchmarks tend to show larger performance drops under perturbation, suggesting that exceptional performance might be masking a fragility to prompt variations. Conversely, models with lower baseline accuracy and certain families like Llama demonstrated greater resilience. The paper also highlights that larger LLMs are generally more sensitive to these rephrasings, implying that increased scale can exacerbate overfitting to prompt structures. C-BOD's agnostic design allows for integration into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   **C-BOD Framework & Overfitting Detection:** C-BOD systematically rephrases benchmark prompts to detect LLMs that overfit to specific phrasing and surface cues, rather than demonstrating true language understanding.\n*   **Paradox of High Accuracy:** Models exhibiting higher baseline accuracy on standard benchmarks are more likely to experience significant performance degradation when prompts are rephrased, indicating their high scores may mask fragility.\n*   **Model Size vs. Performance:** Larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to prompt rephrasings, showing a trend where increased parameter count correlates with greater performance decline, suggesting a susceptibility to overfitting with scale.\n*   **Limitations of C-BOD:** C-BOD primarily addresses textual rephrasing and may not capture deeper forms of overfitting (e.g., factual inaccuracies). Integrating it into training can also be computationally expensive.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify if Large Language Models (LLMs) over-rely on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. C-BOD achieves this by systematically distorting benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic content and correct answers. The core of the user's query, the paradox of high accuracy indicating fragility, is directly addressed: the study found that models with higher baseline accuracy on original benchmarks often exhibit larger performance degradations when faced with these perturbed prompts. This suggests that exceptional performance on standard benchmarks can be a sign of overfitting to specific phrasing, making the models brittle. The research also highlights that larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to rephrasing, indicating a similar reliance on fixed prompt patterns. C-BOD’s methodology involves evaluating LLMs on both original and rephrased datasets and using statistical tests (McNemar's test) to confirm significant performance drops, thereby exposing potential overfitting.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Models with higher baseline accuracy on standard benchmarks are paradoxically more prone to significant performance degradation when prompts are rephrased, indicating fragility.\n*   Larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to prompt rephrasing, suggesting they also over-rely on fixed patterns.\n*   The C-BOD framework systematically distorts prompts to reveal if LLM performance is driven by memorized patterns rather than genuine understanding.\n*   The study found that 20 out of 26 leading LLMs showed statistically significant performance drops on rephrased prompts, indicating widespread overfitting.\n*   C-BOD is a dataset-agnostic meta-evaluation framework that can help move beyond leaderboard scores to prioritize LLM resilience and generalization.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to reveal LLM over-reliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts while preserving semantic content, exposing overfitting by measuring performance degradation. The study found that high accuracy on benchmarks like MMLU can paradoxically indicate fragility, as models with higher baseline accuracy and larger parameter counts tend to exhibit greater performance drops when prompts are rephrased. Specifically, 20 out of 26 evaluated LLMs showed statistically significant performance declines, averaging 2.15%. The research highlights that models like Llama, which have lower baseline accuracy, demonstrate less dependency on superficial cues. This work challenges the LLM community to prioritize resilience and generalization over leaderboard scores, suggesting that C-BOD can be integrated into training pipelines to foster more robust language understanding.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   High benchmark accuracy in LLMs can paradoxically indicate fragility and over-reliance on surface-level cues.\n*   The C-BOD framework systematically rephrases prompts to detect overfitting by measuring performance degradation.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more sensitive to prompt rephrasing, showing greater performance drops.\n*   Most evaluated LLMs (20/26) exhibited statistically significant performance declines on rephrased prompts, averaging 2.15%.\n*   The findings suggest a need to evaluate LLMs for robustness and generalization, moving beyond simple benchmark scores.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify when Large Language Models (LLMs) overfit to specific benchmark prompts. The core idea is that high accuracy on standard benchmarks might mask an overreliance on surface-level cues rather than true understanding. C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts by rephrasing them while preserving semantic content and labels. By evaluating LLMs on both original and perturbed prompts, the framework detects significant performance degradation, indicating overfitting. The study reveals that larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more sensitive to these rephrasings, demonstrating a paradoxical trend: superior performance on benchmarks can be an indicator of fragility. The Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy showed less degradation, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues. C-BOD offers a dataset and model-agnostic approach to promote more robust language understanding by moving beyond leaderboard scores.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   High accuracy on standard LLM benchmarks can paradoxically indicate fragility, as models may overfit to dataset-specific surface cues.\n*   The C-BOD framework detects this overfitting by rephrasing prompts while preserving meaning, revealing performance drops when models rely on specific wording.\n*   Larger LLMs and models with higher baseline accuracy tend to show greater performance degradation under prompt rephrasing, suggesting they are more susceptible to overfitting.\n*   Models like Llama, which exhibit lower baseline accuracy or are smaller, demonstrate more robustness to prompt variations, indicating less reliance on superficial patterns.\n*   The findings challenge the community to prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation over simple leaderboard scores.",

C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic meaning and labels.

The study found that a majority of tested LLMs (20 out of 26) exhibited performance degradation under these perturbations, with an average accuracy drop of 2.15%. Notably, a paradox emerged: models with higher baseline accuracy and larger parameter counts tended to show greater performance degradation, suggesting they over-rely on fixed prompt patterns. Conversely, models with lower baseline accuracy, like the Llama family, demonstrated more robustness. C-BOD's findings challenge the community to look beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify when Large Language Models (LLMs) overfit to specific benchmark prompts rather than demonstrating true language understanding. C-BOD works by systematically rephrasing benchmark questions while preserving their semantic content, then evaluating the LLM on both original and rephrased prompts. A significant performance drop on rephrased prompts, confirmed by McNemar's test, indicates overfitting. The study reveals a paradox: LLMs with higher baseline accuracy tend to exhibit greater performance degradation under these perturbations, suggesting that exceptional performance on standard benchmarks might be due to reliance on superficial cues. The research also found that larger models are generally more sensitive to rephrasing, leading to more pronounced performance drops. While C-BOD effectively detects surface-level overfitting, its limitations include not addressing deeper forms of overfitting and potential high computational costs for mitigation. Future work aims to improve efficiency and capture more nuanced overfitting.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   **Overfitting Paradox:** LLMs with higher original benchmark accuracy are paradoxically more likely to show significant performance degradation when prompts are rephrased, indicating a reliance on dataset-specific cues.\n*   **C-BOD Framework:** The C-BOD framework systematically rephrases benchmark prompts to detect LLM overfitting by measuring performance drops using McNemar's test for statistical significance.\n*   **Model Size vs. Degradation:** Larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to prompt rephrasing, exhibiting greater performance declines, suggesting a correlation between model scale and susceptibility to overfitting.\n*   **McNemar's Test:** This statistical test is crucial for validating whether observed performance differences between original and rephrased prompts are statistically significant, thus confirming overfitting.\n*   **Limitations:** C-BOD primarily targets textual rephrasing and may not detect deeper forms of overfitting, and integrating its mitigation strategies can be computationally expensive.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to expose LLM overreliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts (like MMLU) through paraphrasing while preserving semantic content and labels, then uses McNemar's test to statistically assess performance differences. The study reveals a paradox: models with higher baseline accuracy and larger parameter counts tend to exhibit greater performance degradation under these perturbations, suggesting they are more susceptible to overfitting. Conversely, models with lower baseline accuracy, such as the Llama family, show less degradation, indicating reduced dependency on superficial patterns. The findings challenge the community to look beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation, though C-BOD has limitations in detecting deeper forms of overfitting and can be computationally intensive.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   High benchmark accuracy can paradoxically indicate LLM fragility, as models may overfit to specific prompt phrasings rather than demonstrating true understanding.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher initial accuracy tend to experience more significant performance drops when prompts are rephrased, revealing a vulnerability to superficial cues.\n*   The C-BOD framework uses prompt distortion and McNemar's test to statistically identify this overfitting, showing that many leading LLMs are sensitive to minor rephrasing.\n*   Models like the Llama family, with lower baseline accuracy, exhibited less performance degradation, suggesting a more robust reliance on underlying language understanding.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to expose how Large Language Models (LLMs) over-rely on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. The core idea is to systematically distort benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic content and labels. By rephrasing inputs, C-BOD measures the performance degradation of LLMs. The study's findings reveal a paradox: models with higher baseline accuracy on benchmarks often exhibit larger performance drops when faced with these rephrased prompts. This suggests that high accuracy scores on public benchmarks may mask an overreliance on specific phrasing and memorized patterns, indicating fragility. The research found that larger LLMs also tend to be more sensitive to these perturbations. Conversely, models with lower baseline accuracy showed less degradation, implying a reduced dependency on superficial cues. C-BOD's dataset- and model-agnostic design allows for integration into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding, challenging the community to prioritize resilience over simple leaderboard scores.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to uncover a paradox in LLM evaluations: high accuracy on public benchmarks might indicate fragility due to overreliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic content, revealing how LLMs perform when faced with variations in phrasing. The study found that a significant number of leading LLMs exhibit performance degradation when prompts are rephrased, with models demonstrating higher baseline accuracy and larger parameter counts being more susceptible to this decline. This suggests that exceptional performance on standard benchmarks can be a proxy for overfitting to specific prompt patterns, masking a lack of robust generalization. The findings challenge the community to move beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation, as models with lower baseline accuracy or specific architectures (like Llama) showed less degradation, indicating a reduced dependency on superficial cues.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   High accuracy on benchmarks can mask LLM fragility and overreliance on surface cues, rather than true understanding.\n*   C-BOD, a new framework, detects this overfitting by rephrasing prompts and measuring performance degradation.\n*   Models with higher baseline accuracy and more parameters tend to exhibit greater performance drops under prompt perturbations, highlighting a paradox.\n*   The study found that models with lower baseline accuracy or specific architectures (e.g., Llama) are more robust to these phrasing changes.\n*   The findings advocate for prioritizing LLM resilience and generalization over mere leaderboard scores.",
