SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates strategies for curating compact, high-quality datasets to enhance reinforcement learning (RL) training efficiency for small LLMs under resource constraints. The researchers focused on a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and adapted the GRPO algorithm. They found that using a curated dataset of 7,000 samples, balancing problem difficulty, and employing a cosine reward function led to significant reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%, AIME24 to 46.7%) within strict resource limits (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24 hours, $42 cost). While initial gains were rapid, prolonged training led to instability. The research highlights the efficacy of RL for small LLMs, offering a cost-effective alternative to large-scale approaches, and emphasizes the importance of dataset curation and reward design for balancing problem difficulty and controlling output length to improve training efficiency.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A compact dataset of 7,000 carefully curated mathematical reasoning problems, balancing difficulty, was used to train a small LLM (1.5B parameters) under strict resource constraints.\n*   The GRPO algorithm and a cosine reward function were employed to enhance training efficiency and control output length, achieving significant reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) with minimal cost ($42).\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems in the dataset stabilized early training and improved performance, demonstrating the benefit of a curriculum-like approach for balancing problem difficulty.\n*   The study demonstrates that RL-based fine-tuning can be a cost-effective and data-efficient strategy for improving reasoning in small LLMs, even under significant computational limitations.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research explores strategies for curating compact, high-quality datasets to enhance reinforcement learning (RL) training efficiency for small LLMs under resource constraints. The study focuses on a 1.5B parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, trained on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours. The methodology involves adapting the GRPO algorithm and carefully curating mathematical reasoning datasets. Experiment 1 showed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 from 63% to 70%) with limited high-quality data, but prolonged training leads to degradation. Experiment 2 demonstrated that balancing easy and hard problems with reduced length constraints (7000 samples) improved early performance and stabilized reasoning, with AMC23 reaching 80%. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to control output length, stabilizing completion lengths but yielding slightly lower peak performance. The overall findings highlight the efficacy of RL for small LLMs, achieving competitive results with minimal data and cost ($42), but also reveal limitations such as optimization instability and length constraints, especially with multilingual base models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A compact dataset of 7,000 carefully curated mathematical reasoning samples, balancing problem difficulty, was used to train a small LLM (1.5B parameters) efficiently.\n*   RL-based fine-tuning, specifically using GRPO, enabled significant reasoning improvements in small LLMs, with AMC23 accuracy rising from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7% within a 24-hour training window on limited hardware.\n*   Mixing easier problems with harder ones and employing a cosine reward function proved effective in stabilizing training and controlling output length, mitigating performance degradation seen with prolonged training on complex datasets.\n*   The study achieved these gains with a training cost of approximately $42 and minimal data, significantly outperforming larger models in terms of resource efficiency and demonstrating a viable strategy for resource-constrained environments.\n*   Limitations include optimization instability and the need for extended length constraints for extremely difficult problems, particularly when using multilingual base models, suggesting further research into data curation and reward design.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the efficacy of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints, specifically a 1.5 billion parameter model trained on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours. The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset. They found that by balancing problem difficulty (mixing easy and hard problems) and employing a cosine reward to control output length, they could achieve rapid reasoning gains. For instance, AMC23 accuracy improved from 63% to 80%, and AIME24 reached 46.7%, surpassing a baseline model. This was achieved with only 7,000 samples and a minimal training cost of $42. The study highlights that while RL can significantly boost small LLMs' reasoning with limited resources, challenges like optimization instability and length constraints require careful dataset curation and reward design.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) using RL under strict resource constraints (4x A40 GPUs, 24 hours).\n*   Curating a compact dataset (7,000 samples) that balances problem difficulty (easy and hard) and using a cosine reward for length control are key strategies for efficient training.\n*   This approach is highly cost-effective, with training costs around $42, significantly lower than thousands of dollars for larger models or more extensive datasets.\n*   While RL shows promise, challenges like optimization instability and length limitations necessitate careful tuning of dataset composition and reward functions.",

The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset. Three experiments were conducted on a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, within a 24-hour timeframe using 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs. The results demonstrate significant reasoning gains, with AMC23 accuracy increasing from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, surpassing baseline models like o1-preview. This was achieved using only 7,000 samples and a training cost of approximately $42, a stark contrast to the thousands of dollars typically required. Challenges included optimization instability and length constraints with prolonged training. The study highlights the effectiveness of RL for small LLMs, offering a cost-efficient and data-efficient alternative to large-scale approaches, with released code and datasets for reproducibility.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve substantial reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 from 63% to 80%) using RL and a compact dataset (7,000 samples) under severe resource constraints (4x A40 GPUs, 24 hours).\n*   The GRPO algorithm and a carefully curated dataset, balancing easy and hard problems with cosine rewards for length control, were key to achieving efficient training and competitive performance.\n*   The training cost was remarkably low ($42), significantly outperforming resource-intensive methods for larger models.\n*   Early training stages (50-100 steps) showed rapid gains, but prolonged training led to performance degradation and instability, indicating trade-offs with length constraints.\n*   The curated dataset, refined from existing sources and filtered for quality and difficulty, was crucial for maximizing learning efficiency within limited training budgets.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research explores strategies for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small LLMs (1.5B parameters) under strict resource constraints, using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. The study focuses on curating a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset to balance problem difficulty and improve training efficiency. Experiments revealed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) with minimal data (7,000 samples) and low cost ($42), significantly outperforming larger models and previous small LLM approaches. However, challenges such as optimization instability and length constraints emerged with prolonged training. Specifically, mixing easy and hard problems (Experiment 2) and using a cosine reward for length control (Experiment 3) showed promising results, stabilizing training and improving performance. The study highlights the efficacy of RL-based fine-tuning for small LLMs in resource-limited settings, offering a cost-effective alternative to large-scale methods, while also pointing out limitations like insufficient length limits for complex problems and potential language drift in multilingual base models.\n\n2.

The core methodology involves adapting the GRPO algorithm and curating a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset. Three experiments were conducted: the first showed rapid gains from high-quality data but degraded with prolonged training due to length constraints; the second improved initial performance and stability by mixing easy and hard problems with reduced length limits, though long-term stability remained an issue; the third demonstrated that cosine rewards effectively stabilize completion lengths but require extended limits for complex tasks. In an overall comparison, the developed \"Open-RS\" models achieved competitive performance on benchmarks like AMC23 and AIME24, even surpassing o1-preview on AIME24, using only 7,000 samples and costing $42. This contrasts sharply with the thousands of dollars and much larger datasets required by baseline models. The work highlights the efficacy of RL for small LLMs in resource-constrained settings, while also noting limitations such as optimization instability and length constraints, and suggesting future directions like multi-stage length schedules and language-specific optimizations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 from 63% to 80%, AIME24 to 46.7%) using RL and a curated dataset of 7,000 samples under strict resource constraints (4x A40 GPUs, 24 hours).\n*   The proposed method achieved this with a training cost of approximately $42, drastically lower than thousands of dollars for baseline models, demonstrating high data and computational efficiency.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems in the dataset enhanced initial performance and stabilized reasoning behavior, while cosine rewards effectively controlled output length.\n*   Limitations include optimization instability and performance degradation with prolonged training, particularly due to strict length constraints on complex problems.\n*   Future work should focus on multi-stage length schedules and language-specific optimizations to further improve performance and stability in resource-constrained environments.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The study focuses on a 1.5B parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, trained on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours, costing only $42. The methodology adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and involved curating a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset. Experiment 1 showed rapid initial gains with high-quality data but performance degradation with prolonged training due to length constraints. Experiment 2 improved early performance and stability by balancing easy and hard problems, though long-term stability remained an issue. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to stabilize completion lengths, enhancing consistency at the cost of peak accuracy. The resulting models, Open-RS variants, achieved competitive performance, with Open-RS3 notably surpassing o1-preview on AIME24. The study emphasizes the efficacy of RL for small LLMs with minimal data, offering a cost-effective alternative to larger models, but highlights limitations such as optimization instability and length constraints for complex tasks. Future work includes extending training duration and exploring hybrid methods.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 from 63% to 80%) using RL with a compact dataset (7,000 samples) and minimal resources ($42 cost, 24 hours on 4x A40 GPUs).\n*   Balancing easy and hard problems in the dataset improved initial performance and stability, while using a cosine reward helped stabilize completion lengths.\n*   Despite resource constraints, the fine-tuned 1.5B models achieved competitive performance, with Open-RS3 reaching 46.7% on AIME24, outperforming o1-preview (44.6%).\n*   Limitations include optimization instability and performance degradation with prolonged training under strict length constraints, especially for complex problems requiring extended reasoning.\n*   Future directions involve extending training duration, incorporating explicit language constraints, and exploring hybrid RL and search methods to further enhance reasoning capabilities.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the efficacy of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small LLMs (1.5B parameters) under strict resource constraints (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24 hours). The research team adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning datasets. Three experiments were conducted to explore the impact of data composition and reward functions on training. The findings demonstrate that small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements with minimal data and cost, with one variant (Open-RS3) achieving 46.7% on AIME24, surpassing even larger models like o1-preview. The research highlights that while initial gains are rapid (50-100 steps), prolonged training can lead to performance degradation and instability, particularly due to length constraints and multilingual base models. Balancing dataset difficulty and using cosine rewards for length control were found to improve stability and efficiency. The study concludes that RL-based fine-tuning is a viable and cost-effective strategy for developing reasoning-capable small LLMs, offering a scalable alternative to resource-intensive approaches.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 from 63% to 80%) using RL with a compact dataset (7,000 samples) and minimal resources ($42 cost, 4x A40 GPUs, 24h).\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems in the dataset and using cosine rewards for length control improved training stability and efficiency, although longer training could still lead to degradation.\n*   The curated approach demonstrated strong performance, with one model variant (Open-RS3) achieving the highest AIME24 score (46.7%), outperforming o1-preview and other 1.5B models.\n*   The study successfully demonstrated a cost-effective method for enhancing LLM reasoning, challenging the need for massive datasets and computational resources typical in the field.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research explores strategies for efficiently curating compact datasets to enhance the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under resource constraints. The study focused on a 1.5B parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on limited hardware (4x A40 GPUs, 24 hours). The methodology involved curating high-quality mathematical reasoning datasets by filtering existing sources. Experiment 1 showed rapid initial gains with high-quality data but degraded performance with prolonged training due to length constraints. Experiment 2, by mixing easy and hard problems and reducing length limits, stabilized early performance but still faced long-term issues. Experiment 3, using a cosine reward to control length, improved consistency but highlighted the need for longer completion limits for complex tasks. Overall, the approach achieved competitive reasoning performance (e.g., 46.7% AIME24, surpassing o1-preview) with significantly lower cost ($42) and data usage (7,000 samples) compared to larger models. Key limitations included insufficient length constraints for very hard problems and multilingual drift from the base model.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements with curated, compact datasets (7,000 samples) and RL under severe resource constraints (4x A40 GPUs, 24 hours, $42 cost).\n*   Initial reasoning gains are rapid (50-100 steps), but prolonged training can lead to performance degradation due to length constraints and optimization instability.\n*   Balancing easy and hard problems and using cosine rewards helps stabilize training and control output length, though longer completion limits are needed for extremely complex tasks.\n*   The proposed RL approach significantly outperforms baseline 1.5B models and is cost-effective compared to larger models, demonstrating a viable path for resource-constrained reasoning enhancement.\n*   Limitations include insufficient length constraints for complex problems and potential language drift from multilingual base models.",

The researchers adapted the GRPO algorithm and developed a high-quality, compact mathematical reasoning dataset. Experiment 1 showed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains with limited high-quality data but suffer performance degradation with prolonged training and strict length constraints. Experiment 2 demonstrated that mixing easy and hard problems, along with reduced length constraints, improves early performance and stabilizes reasoning. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to control output length, enhancing consistency but requiring longer completion limits for complex tasks. Overall, their approach, using a 7,000-sample dataset and costing $42, achieved competitive reasoning performance (e.g., AIME24 accuracy of 46.7%) with significantly less data and cost than larger models. Limitations include truncation due to insufficient length limits for complex problems and potential multilingual drift. The findings highlight the viability of RL for small LLMs in resource-constrained environments by carefully balancing problem difficulty and utilizing efficient reward mechanisms.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements with compact, high-quality datasets and RL under strict resource constraints (e.g., 4x A40 GPUs, 24 hours).\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems in the curated dataset enhances early reasoning performance and stabilizes training for small LLMs.\n*   Cosine rewards effectively control output length, improving training consistency, but may require longer completion limits for complex tasks.\n*   The proposed method achieved competitive reasoning scores (e.g., 46.7% on AIME24) with minimal data (7,000 samples) and a low training cost ($42), outperforming many larger models in efficiency.\n*   Limitations include performance degradation with prolonged training under strict length constraints and potential multilingual drift from the base model.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates strategies for curating compact datasets to enhance reinforcement learning (RL) training efficiency for small LLMs under resource constraints. The researchers adapted the GRPO algorithm and developed a high-quality, compact mathematical reasoning dataset. Experiment 1 showed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains with limited high-quality data but suffer performance degradation with prolonged training and strict length constraints. Experiment 2 demonstrated that mixing easy and hard problems, along with reduced length constraints, improves early performance and stabilizes reasoning. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to control output length, enhancing consistency but requiring longer completion limits for complex tasks. Overall, their approach, using a 7,000-sample dataset and costing $42, achieved competitive reasoning performance (e.g., AIME24 accuracy of 46.7%) with significantly less data and cost than larger models. Limitations include truncation due to insufficient length limits for complex problems and potential multilingual drift. The findings highlight the viability of RL for small LLMs in resource-constrained environments by carefully balancing problem difficulty and utilizing efficient reward mechanisms.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements with compact, high-quality datasets and RL under strict resource constraints (e.g., 4x A40 GPUs, 24 hours).\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems in the curated dataset enhances early reasoning performance and stabilizes training for small LLMs.\n*   Cosine rewards effectively control output length, improving training consistency, but may require longer completion limits for complex tasks.\n*   The proposed method achieved competitive reasoning scores (e.g., 46.7% on AIME24) with minimal data (7,000 samples) and a low training cost ($42), outperforming many larger models in efficiency.\n*   Limitations include performance degradation with prolonged training under strict length constraints and potential multilingual drift from the base model.",
