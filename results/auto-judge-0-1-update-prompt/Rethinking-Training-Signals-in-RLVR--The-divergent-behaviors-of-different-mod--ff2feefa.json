SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and reveals a significant lack of technique generalization across different model families. While RLVR, even with spurious or incorrect reward signals, dramatically improves the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Qwen2.5-Math models (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-7B), it yields minimal or even negative gains for other models like Llama3 and OLMo2. This divergence is attributed to pre-existing reasoning strategies within models; Qwen2.5-Math models often leverage \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for problem-solving), which RLVR effectively amplifies, regardless of reward quality. Conversely, models lacking this specific pre-trained capability do not benefit from similar RLVR training. The study concludes that current RLVR research, often focused on Qwen models, may not generalize, and future work should validate findings across a wider range of model architectures to understand these behavioral differences.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR training, even with spurious or incorrect rewards, significantly boosts Qwen2.5-Math models' performance on mathematical reasoning tasks.\n*   These improvements are not generalizable; Llama3 and OLMo2 models show minimal to no gains under identical RLVR training conditions.\n*   The difference in RLVR outcomes is linked to pre-existing reasoning strategies; Qwen models' \"code reasoning\" ability is effectively amplified by RLVR.\n*   Models lacking specific pre-trained reasoning strategies, like code reasoning, do not benefit from the same RLVR techniques.\n*   The research highlights a fundamental lack of technique generalization in RLVR, emphasizing the need for validation across diverse model families.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness across different model families, specifically Qwen, Llama, and OLMo. The study reveals a significant lack of technique generalization, where RLVR training signals that dramatically improve performance in Qwen models, even with spurious rewards (like incorrect labels or random rewards), yield minimal or even detrimental effects on Llama and OLMo models. This divergence is attributed to pre-existing reasoning strategies within models; Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, exhibit strong \"code reasoning\" (using Python for mathematical thinking without execution), which RLVR effectively amplifies. In contrast, other models lack this robust pre-existing capability, rendering the same RLVR techniques ineffective. The findings highlight that RLVR often elicits latent abilities rather than teaching new ones, and emphasize the critical need for future RLVR research to be validated on diverse model architectures to avoid drawing conclusions based solely on Qwen's unique properties.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR, even with spurious rewards, significantly boosts Qwen model performance, while failing to generalize to Llama and OLMo models.\n*   This lack of generalization is linked to pre-existing reasoning strategies; Qwen models benefit from RLVR amplifying their \"code reasoning\" capabilities.\n*   Other model families (Llama, OLMo) do not exhibit the same pre-existing reasoning strategies that RLVR can effectively elicit.\n*   The study suggests RLVR primarily surfaces latent abilities learned during pretraining, rather than imparting new skills.\n*   A practical warning is issued for future RLVR research to validate findings across diverse models, not just Qwen, due to observed model-specific sensitivities.",

SUMMARY:\nThe paper \"Spurious Rewards: Rethinking Training Signals in RLVR\" reveals a significant lack of technique generalization in Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) across different model families. While RLVR, even with intentionally flawed or \"spurious\" rewards (e.g., incorrect labels, random rewards), dramatically improves mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, these same techniques yield minimal or even negative gains on other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2. This divergence suggests that the effectiveness of RLVR is heavily dependent on the base model's pre-training. Specifically, Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a unique \"code reasoning\" behavior (generating Python code to aid reasoning without execution), which RLVR effectively amplifies, leading to performance boosts. In contrast, other models either lack this capability or their dominant reasoning strategies do not correlate with correctness, rendering spurious rewards ineffective. The study concludes that RLVR primarily elicits latent abilities rather than teaching new ones, and future research should validate findings across diverse model architectures.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards significantly boosts Qwen2.5-Math model performance, often matching ground truth rewards.\n*   These same spurious rewards fail to improve Llama3 and OLMo2 models, indicating a lack of generalizability across model families.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for mathematical tasks) which RLVR effectively amplifies, correlating with performance gains.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is hypothesized to stem from eliciting pre-existing, beneficial reasoning strategies inherent in the base model's pre-training.\n*   Future RLVR research needs validation on diverse models, not just Qwen variants, to ensure broader applicability and avoid drawing conclusions based on model-specific behaviors.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness across different model families, specifically Qwen, Llama, and OLMo. The study reveals a significant lack of generalization for RLVR techniques, particularly when employing \"spurious rewards\" (e.g., random or incorrect labels). While Qwen models, especially Qwen2.5-Math, show substantial performance gains even with these flawed reward signals, Llama and OLMo models exhibit minimal improvement or even degradation. This divergence is attributed to pre-training differences, with Qwen models demonstrating a unique propensity for \"code reasoning\" (using Python to assist mathematical problem-solving without actual execution). RLVR effectively amplifies this pre-existing code reasoning capability in Qwen models, leading to performance boosts. However, this mechanism does not translate to other model families, underscoring the fundamental issue of technique generalization in RLVR. The findings suggest that future RLVR research should be validated on diverse models rather than relying on a single, de facto choice like Qwen.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR training with spurious rewards yields significant performance gains on Qwen models but fails to generalize to Llama and OLMo models, highlighting a lack of technique generalization.\n*   Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, exhibit a unique \"code reasoning\" behavior (using Python for problem-solving) that is effectively amplified by RLVR, even with weak or incorrect reward signals.\n*   Differences in pre-training data and learned reasoning strategies are identified as the primary drivers for the divergent RLVR outcomes across model families.\n*   The study emphasizes the need for future RLVR research to be validated on a diverse range of models to ensure robustness and avoid conclusions based on model-specific behaviors.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness across different model families, specifically Qwen, Llama, and OLMo. The study found that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen models even with \"spurious\" rewards (e.g., incorrect labels, random rewards, or format adherence). These spurious rewards yielded gains comparable to ground truth rewards for Qwen models. However, these same spurious rewards largely failed to improve Llama and OLMo models, demonstrating a fundamental lack of technique generalization. The research hypothesizes that Qwen models' pre-training data, which encourages \"code reasoning\" (using Python-like code for mathematical thought without execution), allows them to surface latent reasoning abilities that RLVR can then amplify. This code reasoning behavior is a distinctive trait of Qwen models that is not effectively elicited in other families, explaining the divergent outcomes. The findings serve as a critical warning for RLVR research, emphasizing the need for validation across diverse models rather than relying solely on Qwen models, as observed trends may not be universally applicable.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR training with spurious rewards (incorrect labels, random, format) significantly boosts mathematical reasoning in Qwen models, often matching ground truth reward performance.\n*   These same spurious rewards yield minimal or negative gains on Llama and OLMo model families, indicating a lack of generalization for RLVR techniques.\n*   Qwen models exhibit a unique \"code reasoning\" behavior (using code for thought) that is strongly correlated with performance and is effectively amplified by RLVR, even with spurious rewards.\n*   The divergence in RLVR outcomes across model families is attributed to differences in pre-training data and the resulting reasoning strategies that RLVR can elicit.\n*   The study issues a practical warning: RLVR research conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models may not generalize; validation across diverse model architectures is crucial.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and uncovers a significant lack of technique generalization across different model families. While RLVR, even with spurious or weak reward signals (like random rewards, incorrect labels, or format adherence), can dramatically improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, these same techniques often fail to yield gains or even degrade performance in other models such as Llama3 and OLMo2. This divergence is attributed to differences in pretraining, with Qwen2.5-Math models exhibiting a unique \"code reasoning\" capability (generating Python code for problem-solving without execution) that RLVR effectively amplifies. Conversely, models lacking this pre-existing behavior do not benefit from spurious rewards. The study highlights that RLVR primarily elicits latent abilities learned during pretraining rather than teaching new ones, emphasizing the critical need for cross-model validation in RLVR research to avoid drawing conclusions based on model-specific behaviors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels) significantly boosts Qwen2.5-Math models' reasoning, often matching ground truth rewards.\n*   These same spurious reward techniques fail to generalize to other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, causing minimal gains or performance degradation.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a distinct \"code reasoning\" ability (using Python for problem-solving) that RLVR successfully amplifies, unlike other model families.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is highly dependent on the model's pretraining, which instills specific reasoning strategies that can be elicited.\n*   The study underscores the necessity of validating RLVR findings across diverse model architectures, not just Qwen models, due to the lack of technique generalization.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThe paper \"Spurious Rewards: Rethinking Training Signals in RLVR\" investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) across different model families, specifically Qwen, Llama, and OLMo. A key finding is the significant performance gains observed in Qwen models, even when trained with weak or entirely spurious reward signals (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels). This contrasts sharply with Llama and OLMo models, which show minimal to negative improvements under the same spurious training conditions. This divergence highlights a fundamental lack of technique generalization in RLVR. The research hypothesizes that Qwen models' pre-training, particularly their strong propensity for \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid mathematical problem-solving), allows them to leverage these weak signals to surface latent reasoning abilities. In contrast, models lacking this specific pre-trained behavior do not benefit from spurious rewards, underscoring the critical role of pre-training data and learned strategies in RLVR outcomes. The authors strongly advocate for validating RLVR research on diverse model families, not just the de facto Qwen choice, to avoid drawing potentially misleading conclusions.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen models exhibit substantial performance gains from RLVR even with spurious rewards (random, incorrect labels), while Llama and OLMo models do not, indicating a lack of generalization.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards in Qwen models is strongly linked to their pre-trained \"code reasoning\" capability, which RLVR appears to amplify.\n*   Models lacking specific pre-trained reasoning strategies, like code reasoning in Llama and OLMo, do not benefit from spurious RLVR signals, highlighting the influence of pre-training data.\n*   The study emphasizes the critical need for cross-model validation in RLVR research, as findings on one model family (like Qwen) may not hold true for others.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness across different model families, specifically Qwen, Llama, and OLMo. The core finding is a significant lack of technique generalization in RLVR, where training signals that boost performance in Qwen models, even spurious ones like random or incorrect rewards, often fail to yield similar gains in Llama or OLMo models. This divergence is attributed to differences in pre-training, with Qwen models exhibiting a unique \"code reasoning\" behavior (generating Python code to aid mathematical reasoning) that is effectively amplified by RLVR. Even weak or random rewards can elicit substantial performance improvements in Qwen models by leveraging this pre-existing capability, while other models do not benefit. The research highlights that RLVR primarily surfaces latent abilities rather than teaching new ones, and underscores the critical need to validate RLVR techniques on diverse model architectures, not just Qwen variants, to avoid drawing misleading conclusions. The study also touches upon \"bad-code\" models where code usage correlates with worse performance, suggesting that the effectiveness of RLVR is highly dependent on the model's inherent reasoning strategies and how well they align with the training objectives.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR training with spurious rewards (random, incorrect, format) significantly improves Qwen models' performance, often matching ground truth rewards, but fails to generalize to Llama and OLMo models.\n*   This lack of generalization is linked to Qwen models' unique \"code reasoning\" ability, where they generate Python code to assist in mathematical problem-solving, a behavior amplified by RLVR.\n*   RLVR appears to elicit pre-existing reasoning capabilities rather than teaching new ones, with the effectiveness of spurious rewards depending on whether the model's dominant pre-training behaviors correlate with correctness.\n*   The study emphasizes the importance of cross-model validation, warning that conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models may not apply to other model families due to differing pre-training priors and reasoning strategies.\n*   \"Bad-code\" models demonstrate that while code generation can be elicited, it doesn't guarantee performance gains if the underlying code reasoning is suboptimal for that model.",

SUMMARY:\nThe paper \"Spurious Rewards: Rethinking Training Signals in RLVR\" investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) across different model families, specifically highlighting a fundamental lack of technique generalization. The study reveals that while RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models even with spurious rewards (like incorrect labels or random rewards), these same techniques yield minimal or no gains on other models such as Llama3 and OLMo2. This divergence is attributed to differences in pre-training, with Qwen2.5-Math models exhibiting a distinct \"code reasoning\" behavior—using Python code to aid problem-solving without actual execution—which RLVR effectively amplifies. This code reasoning is shown to be highly correlated with performance gains in Qwen models. The research underscores that RLVR's effectiveness is heavily dependent on the pre-existing reasoning strategies within a model, and that conclusions drawn from one model family may not generalize. Consequently, the authors stress the importance of validating RLVR techniques across diverse models rather than relying solely on Qwen models, which have become a de facto standard.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR training with spurious rewards significantly improves Qwen2.5-Math models but shows little to no benefit for Llama3 or OLMo2 models, indicating a lack of generalization across model families.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR, even with weak or incorrect reward signals, is strongly linked to pre-existing reasoning strategies within a model, such as the \"code reasoning\" observed in Qwen2.5-Math.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a unique capability for code reasoning that is effectively amplified by RLVR, leading to performance gains where other models fail to benefit.\n*   The study emphasizes the critical need for cross-model validation of RLVR techniques, as findings on one model family (like Qwen) do not reliably transfer to others due to differences in pre-training.\n*   Spurious rewards can elicit performance improvements by surfacing latent reasoning abilities, but this elicitation is model-dependent, highlighting the significant impact of pre-training data and strategies on RLVR outcomes.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness across different language model families, specifically Qwen, Llama, and OLMo. The study reveals a fundamental lack of technique generalization, as spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format-based) that significantly improve performance in Qwen models often fail to yield gains, or even degrade performance, in Llama and OLMo models. This divergence is attributed to pre-training differences. Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, exhibit a strong propensity for \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid mathematical problem-solving), a behavior that RLVR effectively amplifies even with weak or noisy reward signals. This code reasoning capability is shown to be highly predictive of performance and is largely absent or less effective in Llama and OLMo models. The findings underscore the critical need to validate RLVR techniques on diverse model architectures rather than relying on a single de facto choice like Qwen, as observed improvements may not be generalizable.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards significantly boosts Qwen model performance, but these rewards fail to generalize to Llama and OLMo models, indicating a lack of technique generalization.\n*   Qwen models, especially Qwen2.5-Math, exhibit a distinct \"code reasoning\" behavior (using Python for math) that RLVR effectively amplifies, correlating with improved accuracy.\n*   Differences in pre-training data and learned reasoning strategies (like code reasoning) are hypothesized to explain why RLVR effects vary across model families.\n*   The study emphasizes the necessity of validating RLVR research across diverse models, not just Qwen, to ensure generalizability and avoid misleading conclusions.\n*   Spurious rewards can elicit performance gains by leveraging pre-existing, beneficial reasoning patterns within a model, rather than imparting new knowledge.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness across different language model families, specifically Qwen, Llama, and OLMo. The study reveals a fundamental lack of technique generalization, as spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format-based) that significantly improve performance in Qwen models often fail to yield gains, or even degrade performance, in Llama and OLMo models. This divergence is attributed to pre-training differences. Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, exhibit a strong propensity for \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid mathematical problem-solving), a behavior that RLVR effectively amplifies even with weak or noisy reward signals. This code reasoning capability is shown to be highly predictive of performance and is largely absent or less effective in Llama and OLMo models. The findings underscore the critical need to validate RLVR techniques on diverse model architectures rather than relying on a single de facto choice like Qwen, as observed improvements may not be generalizable.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards significantly boosts Qwen model performance, but these rewards fail to generalize to Llama and OLMo models, indicating a lack of technique generalization.\n*   Qwen models, especially Qwen2.5-Math, exhibit a distinct \"code reasoning\" behavior (using Python for math) that RLVR effectively amplifies, correlating with improved accuracy.\n*   Differences in pre-training data and learned reasoning strategies (like code reasoning) are hypothesized to explain why RLVR effects vary across model families.\n*   The study emphasizes the necessity of validating RLVR research across diverse models, not just Qwen, to ensure generalizability and avoid misleading conclusions.\n*   Spurious rewards can elicit performance gains by leveraging pre-existing, beneficial reasoning patterns within a model, rather than imparting new knowledge.",
