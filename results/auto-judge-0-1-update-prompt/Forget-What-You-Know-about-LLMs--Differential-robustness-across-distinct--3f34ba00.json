SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD) to evaluate how LLMs rely on surface-level cues in benchmarks, rather than true language understanding. By systematically rephrasing benchmark prompts while preserving semantic meaning, C-BOD exposes models prone to overfitting. The study found that most LLMs, particularly larger ones, exhibit a significant performance drop when presented with these rephrased prompts, indicating a dependency on specific phrasing. Notably, the Llama family of models and those with lower baseline accuracy demonstrated more robustness and less degradation, suggesting a reduced reliance on superficial patterns. The research highlights that high benchmark scores can be misleading, as models with superior performance on original prompts often show greater sensitivity to rephrasing, implying they leverage memorized patterns. C-BOD's dataset and model-agnostic design allows for broader application, encouraging a shift towards evaluating LLM resilience and generalization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs, especially larger ones, tend to overfit to benchmark-specific surface cues, leading to performance degradation when prompts are rephrased.\n*   The Llama family of models and those with lower baseline accuracy exhibited greater robustness to prompt rephrasing, indicating less reliance on superficial patterns.\n*   Models achieving higher baseline accuracy on original benchmarks were more sensitive to prompt perturbations, suggesting their performance might be driven by memorization.\n*   C-BOD is a framework that quantifies LLM overfitting by measuring performance differences between original and semantically equivalent but rephrased prompts.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify if Large Language Models (LLMs) over-rely on surface-level cues in benchmark prompts rather than demonstrating true language understanding. C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic content and labels, then measures performance degradation. When applied to the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs, C-BOD revealed an average performance drop of 2.15% under moderate perturbations, with 20 models showing statistically significant declines. A key finding is that larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more sensitive to these rephrasing changes, indicating a greater reliance on fixed prompt patterns. In contrast, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy exhibited less degradation, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues. The framework's dataset- and model-agnostic design allows for integration into training pipelines to promote robustness. However, C-BOD's limitations include potential oversight of deeper overfitting forms and increased computational costs for iterative retraining.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   **C-BOD Framework:** C-BOD is a meta-evaluation framework that detects LLM overfitting by systematically rephrasing benchmark prompts and measuring performance degradation.\n*   **Overfitting Detection:** The study found that 20 out of 26 evaluated LLMs showed statistically significant performance drops when prompts were perturbed, indicating widespread reliance on surface-level cues.\n*   **LLM Performance Degradation:** On average, LLMs experienced a 2.15% accuracy decrease on rephrased prompts, with models exhibiting higher baseline accuracy and larger parameter counts showing more pronounced degradation.\n*   **Model Size vs. Robustness:** Larger LLMs generally demonstrated greater performance degradation, suggesting they may over-rely on fixed prompt patterns.\n*   **Accuracy vs. Robustness:** A positive correlation was observed between a model's original benchmark accuracy and its performance degradation under rephrasing, highlighting a potential \"overfitting paradox.\"",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify over-reliance on surface-level cues in Large Language Models (LLMs). C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts while preserving semantic content and labels, exposing LLMs that have overfitted to specific wording or structure. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs revealed that most models exhibit a performance degradation under these perturbations, indicating a widespread issue of overfitting. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy showed a greater tendency to overfit, suggesting that high scores on standard benchmarks may not always reflect true language understanding. In contrast, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy demonstrated more robustness. The framework's dataset- and model-agnostic design allows for integration into training pipelines to promote more generalizable language understanding, challenging the community to prioritize resilience over leaderboard scores.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The C-BOD framework detects LLM overfitting by rephrasing benchmark prompts, revealing performance degradation due to reliance on surface cues.\n*   A significant majority of evaluated LLMs (20 out of 26) showed performance drops under prompt perturbations, indicating widespread overfitting to benchmark formats.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy are more susceptible to performance degradation when prompts are rephrased, suggesting a potential trade-off between scale/performance and robustness.\n*   The Llama family of models and those with lower baseline accuracy exhibited greater robustness to prompt rephrasing, indicating reduced dependency on superficial cues.\n*   C-BOD's limitations include not capturing deeper forms of overfitting (e.g., factual inaccuracies) and potential computational costs when integrated into training pipelines.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD) framework, designed to expose LLMs' overreliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts (using MMLU as a test case) while preserving semantic content, revealing how performance degrades under these perturbations. The study found that 20 out of 26 evaluated LLMs exhibited statistically significant performance drops, averaging 2.15% with modest rephrasing. A key finding is the differential robustness across LLM architectural families: larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more sensitive to rephrasing, suggesting they overfit fixed prompt patterns. In contrast, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy demonstrated insignificant degradation, indicating reduced dependency on superficial cues. While C-BOD is effective for detecting surface-level overfitting, its limitations include overlooking deeper forms of overfitting and the potential high computational cost of iterative rephrasing for training pipelines.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   **C-BOD Framework:** This meta-evaluation framework systematically distorts benchmark prompts to detect LLM overfitting to surface cues.\n*   **Overfitting in LLMs:** A significant portion of LLMs (20/26) show performance degradation under prompt rephrasing, indicating over-reliance on specific phrasing rather than true understanding.\n*   **Model Size vs. Performance:** Larger LLMs generally exhibit greater performance degradation when prompts are rephrased, suggesting a correlation between scale and sensitivity to prompt variations.\n*   **Accuracy vs. Performance:** Models with higher baseline accuracy on original benchmarks tend to experience larger performance drops when faced with rephrased prompts, highlighting a potential paradox in LLM evaluation.\n*   **Llama Family Robustness:** The Llama family of models, particularly smaller versions, showed insignificant performance degradation, indicating greater robustness and less dependency on superficial cues.\n*   **Gemma Family Sensitivity:** Models within the Gemma family demonstrated a progressive increase in performance degradation with higher parameter counts, aligning with the trend of larger models being more sensitive.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD) framework, designed to reveal LLM overreliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. By systematically rephrasing benchmark prompts while preserving semantic content, C-BOD detects overfitting. Evaluations on the MMLU benchmark using 26 LLMs revealed an average performance degradation of 2.15% under modest perturbations, with 20 models showing statistically significant drops. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more sensitive to rephrasing, indicating a reliance on fixed prompt patterns. In contrast, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy demonstrated insignificant degradation, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues. The framework's dataset- and model-agnostic design allows for integration into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding, challenging the community to prioritize resilience over leaderboard scores.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The C-BOD framework systematically distorts benchmark prompts to detect LLM overfitting to surface-level cues.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy are more susceptible to performance degradation when prompts are rephrased.\n*   The Llama family of models exhibited greater robustness to prompt perturbations compared to other families.\n*   Gemma family models, especially larger ones, showed increased sensitivity to rephrasing, indicating potential overfitting.\n*   The study highlights that high benchmark scores may mask underlying vulnerabilities to prompt variations, emphasizing the need for robust evaluation.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify how heavily Large Language Models (LLMs) overfit to specific benchmark prompts. C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark questions while preserving their semantic meaning and correct answers, and then measures the resulting performance degradation. When applied to the MMLU benchmark across 26 LLMs, C-BOD revealed that most models (20 out of 26) experienced a statistically significant performance drop, averaging 2.15%. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy showed a greater tendency to overfit, suggesting they rely more on superficial cues. Conversely, the Llama family of models, particularly smaller ones, and models with lower initial accuracy, exhibited less degradation, indicating a reduced dependency on specific prompt patterns. The study highlights a paradox where high benchmark scores might mask a lack of true generalization, emphasizing the need for more robust evaluation methods.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   **C-BOD Framework:** C-BOD is a meta-evaluation framework that detects LLM overfitting by rephrasing benchmark prompts to assess performance degradation under textual perturbations.\n*   **Overfitting Detection:** The study found that 20 out of 26 LLMs showed statistically significant performance drops (average 2.15%) on rephrased prompts, indicating widespread overfitting to benchmark-specific cues.\n*   **Model Size & Accuracy vs. Performance:** Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy on original benchmarks tended to exhibit greater performance declines when prompts were perturbed, suggesting a reliance on surface-level patterns.\n*   **Llama Family Robustness:** The Llama family, especially smaller models, demonstrated greater robustness, showing insignificant performance degradation under prompt rephrasing, implying less dependency on superficial cues.\n*   **Gemma Family Sensitivity:** The Gemma family, particularly larger models within the family, showed a progressive increase in performance degradation with higher parameter counts, aligning with the trend of larger models being more sensitive to perturbations.\n*   **Limitations of C-BOD:** C-BOD primarily targets textual rephrasing and may not capture deeper forms of overfitting. Integrating its transformations into training can also be computationally expensive.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify LLM overfitting to dataset-specific surface cues. C-BOD systematically rephrases benchmark prompts while preserving semantic content and then compares model performance on original versus perturbed prompts. Evaluated on the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs, C-BOD revealed that most models exhibit a statistically significant performance degradation (average of 2.15%) under modest rephrasing, indicating reliance on memorized patterns rather than true understanding. A key finding is the differential robustness across LLM families: larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more sensitive to perturbations, suggesting they over-rely on prompt patterns. Conversely, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy demonstrated reduced degradation, indicating greater robustness. The study highlights that high benchmark scores may mask underlying vulnerabilities, urging a shift towards evaluating LLM resilience and generalization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD systematically detects LLM overfitting by rephrasing prompts and measuring performance changes, revealing that many models rely on surface cues.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher initial accuracy are more susceptible to performance drops under prompt perturbations, indicating a potential over-reliance on fixed patterns.\n*   The Llama family of LLMs exhibits notable robustness, showing insignificant performance degradation when prompts are rephrased, unlike more sensitive models like Gemma.\n*   The findings challenge current LLM evaluation practices, suggesting that high benchmark scores may not always reflect genuine language understanding or generalization capabilities.\n*   C-BOD is dataset- and model-agnostic, offering a framework to promote more resilient LLM development and evaluation.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to uncover LLM overreliance on surface-level cues in benchmark datasets. C-BOD systematically distorts prompts by rephrasing them while preserving semantic meaning and labels, then measures performance degradation. Evaluating 26 LLMs on the MMLU benchmark revealed that most models exhibit a significant performance drop under these perturbations, indicating overfitting. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy showed a greater tendency to overfit, suggesting that high benchmark scores may mask vulnerabilities to prompt variations. Conversely, the Llama family and models with lower initial accuracy demonstrated more robustness. The study highlights that LLM architectural choices and training strategies influence their susceptibility to overfitting, emphasizing the need to move beyond leaderboard scores to prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD detects LLM overfit by measuring performance degradation on semantically preserved, rephrased prompts.\n*   Most evaluated LLMs (20 out of 26) showed significant performance drops on perturbed prompts, indicating overfitting to benchmark-specific phrasing.\n*   Larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy exhibited a greater tendency to overfit, suggesting their high scores might be due to memorized patterns.\n*   The Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy demonstrated more robustness to prompt rephrasing.\n*   The findings challenge traditional LLM evaluation, advocating for a focus on resilience and generalization over simple benchmark scores.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify LLMs that overfit to benchmark-specific surface cues rather than demonstrating true language understanding. C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts while preserving semantic content and labels. Evaluation on the MMLU benchmark using 26 LLMs revealed an average performance degradation of 2.15% under these perturbations, with 20 models showing statistically significant drops. A key finding is the differential robustness across LLM architectural families and sizes: larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more sensitive to rephrasings, indicating a greater reliance on fixed prompt patterns. Conversely, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy showed less degradation, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues. While C-BOD is effective at detecting surface-level overfitting, its limitations include potential oversight of deeper forms of overfitting and the computational cost of integrating its transformations into training pipelines.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD is a framework that detects LLM overfitting to benchmark-specific cues by applying parametric textual distortions to prompts.\n*   LLMs exhibit differential robustness, with larger models and those achieving higher baseline accuracy generally showing greater performance degradation under prompt rephrasing.\n*   The Llama family of models demonstrated reduced sensitivity to prompt perturbations, indicating more robust language understanding compared to other families.\n*   Overfitting to benchmark-specific cues is widespread, as evidenced by a significant average performance drop of 2.15% across 26 LLMs when tested on rephrased prompts.\n*   C-BOD's limitations include a focus on surface-level overfitting and the potential for high computational cost when integrated into training.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to uncover LLM overfitting to specific benchmark surface cues. C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts while preserving semantic content and labels, then evaluates LLMs on both original and perturbed versions. By analyzing performance differences and using McNemar's test for statistical significance, C-BOD detects reliance on memorized patterns rather than true language understanding. The study evaluated 26 LLMs on the MMLU benchmark, revealing an average performance degradation of 2.15% under modest rephrasing. Notably, larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy exhibited greater performance drops, indicating a tendency to overfit fixed prompt patterns. Conversely, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy showed less degradation, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues. The findings challenge the community to prioritize resilience and generalization over leaderboard scores, highlighting architectural choices and training strategies as key factors in mitigating overfitting.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts to detect LLM overfitting to surface cues, revealing actual language understanding.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy are more prone to performance degradation when prompts are rephrased.\n*   The Llama family of models demonstrated greater robustness to prompt perturbations compared to many other LLMs.\n*   High performance on standard benchmarks may mask an overreliance on memorized patterns rather than genuine generalization.\n*   The research advocates for evaluating LLMs based on resilience and generalization rather than solely on leaderboard scores.",
