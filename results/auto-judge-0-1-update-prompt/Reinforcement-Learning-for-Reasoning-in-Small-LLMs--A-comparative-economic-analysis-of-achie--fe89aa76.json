SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the economic viability and effectiveness of using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the reasoning capabilities of small language models (LLMs) under strict computational constraints. Researchers fine-tuned a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, using the GRPO algorithm and a curated mathematical reasoning dataset. The experiments were conducted on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours, with a training cost of approximately $42. The results demonstrate significant reasoning gains, with AMC23 accuracy increasing from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, outperforming a comparable OpenAI model (o1-preview) and other baselines. These improvements were achieved with a small dataset of 7,000 samples. However, challenges such as optimization instability and length constraints were observed with prolonged training. The study concludes that RL-based fine-tuning is a cost-effective alternative for enhancing small LLMs' reasoning, offering a path towards more accessible, reasoning-capable AI.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reinforcement learning can significantly boost the reasoning performance of small LLMs (1.5B parameters) under strict resource constraints.\n*   Achieving state-of-the-art reasoning on benchmarks like AMC23 and AIME24 is possible with minimal data (7,000 samples) and a low training cost ($42).\n*   This approach offers a cost-effective alternative to resource-intensive methods typically used for large LLMs.\n*   Challenges include optimization instability and length limitations with extended training, and the multilingual nature of base models can lead to language drift.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the economic feasibility and effectiveness of using reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance reasoning capabilities in small language models (LLMs) under strict computational constraints. The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a high-quality, compact mathematical reasoning dataset (7,000 samples) for a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Training was conducted on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours, costing approximately $42. The results demonstrate significant rapid reasoning gains, with AMC23 accuracy increasing from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, outperforming baseline models like o1-preview. However, prolonged training led to optimization instability and length constraints. The study highlights that RL-based fine-tuning offers a cost-effective alternative to large-scale approaches for improving small LLMs' reasoning, making advanced AI more accessible. The code and datasets are released as open-source resources.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reinforcement learning (RL) can significantly improve reasoning in small LLMs (1.5B parameters) under tight resource constraints (4 GPUs, 24 hours, ~$42 cost).\n*   A curated dataset of 7,000 mathematical reasoning samples enabled rapid performance gains, with AMC23 accuracy rising from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%.\n*   The GRPO algorithm and a rule-based reward system (accuracy, cosine, format) were adapted for efficiency, proving more cost-effective than training larger models.\n*   Challenges like optimization instability and length limitations emerged with extended training, indicating trade-offs in achieving peak performance with small models.\n*   The findings suggest RL-based fine-tuning is a viable and economical strategy for developing reasoning-capable small LLMs, democratizing access to advanced AI.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the economic feasibility and performance of using reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance reasoning in small language models (LLMs), specifically a 1.5-billion-parameter model. The research highlights that achieving state-of-the-art reasoning performance in smaller models is possible with significantly fewer computational resources and lower costs compared to large models. By adapting the GRPO algorithm and curating a high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset, the researchers trained a small LLM on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours for approximately $42. This approach resulted in competitive reasoning scores, with one variant (Open-RS3) achieving the highest AIME24 score (46.7%), surpassing the o1-preview model. The study demonstrates that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains with limited data, but also identifies challenges like optimization instability and length constraints. Ultimately, the findings position RL-based fine-tuning as a cost-effective and scalable alternative for developing reasoning-capable LLMs in resource-constrained environments, with the released code and datasets facilitating further research.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve competitive reasoning performance using RL with significantly lower costs (e.g., $42) and fewer resources (4x A40 GPUs in 24 hours) compared to large models.\n*   The study demonstrated rapid reasoning improvements in a 1.5B parameter model, with specific benchmarks showing accuracy gains from 63% to 80% (AMC23) and achieving 46.7% on AIME24, outperforming the o1-preview model.\n*   A curated dataset of 7,000 high-quality mathematical reasoning samples was sufficient to train the small LLM effectively, showcasing high data efficiency.\n*   Despite successes, challenges like optimization instability and length limitations were observed, particularly with prolonged training, suggesting trade-offs in achieving peak performance.\n*   The research offers a cost-effective and scalable approach to reasoning enhancement for small LLMs, democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the economic feasibility and effectiveness of using reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance reasoning capabilities in small language models (LLMs) under strict computational constraints. The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset (7,000 samples) to fine-tune a 1.5-billion-parameter model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B). The experiments demonstrated rapid reasoning gains, with accuracy on AMC23 improving from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, surpassing a comparable OpenAI model (o1-preview). This was achieved with a remarkably low training cost of approximately $42, using only 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours. While challenges like optimization instability and length constraints were observed with prolonged training, the findings highlight RL as a cost-effective alternative to large-scale approaches for developing reasoning-capable small LLMs. The research also emphasizes the importance of dataset quality, mixing problem difficulties, and using specific reward functions (like cosine reward for length control) for optimal performance within resource limitations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reinforcement learning (RL) can significantly improve reasoning in small LLMs (1.5B parameters) under strict resource constraints (4 GPUs, 24 hours).\n*   The study achieved state-of-the-art reasoning performance on benchmarks like AIME24 (46.7%) and AMC23 (80%) with a minimal training cost of ~$42.\n*   Key methodological choices included adapting GRPO, curating a compact (7,000 samples) high-quality mathematical dataset, and using a cosine reward for length control.\n*   While initial rapid gains are achievable, prolonged training can lead to instability and performance degradation due to length constraints and base model characteristics (e.g., multilingualism).\n*   This approach offers a cost-effective and scalable alternative to resource-intensive methods typically used for large LLMs, democratizing access to advanced reasoning capabilities.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the economic feasibility and effectiveness of using reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of small language models (LLMs) under strict computational constraints. The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset (7,000 samples) to train a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. The training was conducted on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours, costing approximately $42. Results showed rapid reasoning gains, with AMC23 accuracy increasing from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, surpassing a baseline model (o1-preview). While this approach demonstrates significant cost and data efficiency compared to large-scale methods, challenges like optimization instability and length constraints emerged with prolonged training. The study highlights the potential of RL for small LLMs in resource-limited environments and releases code and datasets to foster further research.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reinforcement learning (RL) can significantly enhance the reasoning performance of small LLMs (1.5B parameters) under strict computational constraints (4x A40 GPUs, 24 hours, ~$42 cost).\n*   A curated dataset of 7,000 mathematical reasoning samples, combined with GRPO, enabled rapid accuracy improvements on benchmarks like AMC23 (63% to 80%) and AIME24 (reaching 46.7%).\n*   This RL-based fine-tuning approach offers a highly cost-effective and data-efficient alternative to resource-intensive methods used for larger models.\n*   Challenges encountered include optimization instability and performance degradation with prolonged training, as well as limitations imposed by fixed output length constraints for complex problems.\n*   The study emphasizes the viability of RL for democratizing advanced reasoning capabilities in LLMs for resource-constrained settings.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the efficacy of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small language models (LLMs) under strict computational constraints. The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset. They trained a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours, using only 7,000 samples and costing $42. The results demonstrated significant and rapid reasoning gains, with AMC23 accuracy increasing from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, outperforming the o1-preview model. However, challenges such as optimization instability and length constraints emerged with prolonged training. The study concludes that RL-based fine-tuning offers a cost-effective and scalable alternative to large-scale approaches for improving small LLMs' reasoning, and the code and datasets are released as open-source resources.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) using RL under strict resource constraints (4 GPUs, 24 hours, $42 cost, 7,000 samples).\n*   The adapted GRPO algorithm and a curated dataset enabled a 1.5B model to surpass the o1-preview model on AIME24.\n*   Early training (50-100 steps) showed rapid gains, but prolonged training led to performance degradation and instability, particularly due to length constraints.\n*   Mixing easier and harder problems, along with using a cosine reward for length control, improved initial performance and training stability.\n*   The approach is significantly more cost-effective and data-efficient compared to training larger models or other small models like DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview.",

The researchers fine-tuned a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, under strict computational constraints (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24 hours). They adapted the GRPO algorithm and curated a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset. Experiments demonstrated rapid reasoning gains, with AMC23 accuracy increasing from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, outperforming a baseline model, all at a minimal cost of $42. This contrasts sharply with the thousands of dollars typically required for larger models. However, challenges like optimization instability and length constraints emerged with prolonged training. The findings highlight RL's cost-effectiveness for small LLMs, offering a scalable alternative for resource-constrained environments, with code and datasets released openly.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reinforcement learning (RL) can significantly improve reasoning in small LLMs (1.5B parameters) under strict resource constraints.\n*   The approach achieved high performance on math benchmarks (e.g., AMC23: 80%, AIME24: 46.7%) with a training cost of only $42, drastically lower than large-model methods.\n*   Key challenges encountered include optimization instability and limitations imposed by maximum output length constraints.\n*   A mix of easy and hard problems, along with cosine rewards for length control, showed promise in stabilizing training and improving performance.\n*   The study demonstrates the potential for cost-effective, scalable reasoning capabilities in LLMs for resource-limited settings.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the efficacy of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small language models (LLMs) under strict computational constraints. The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset for a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Training was conducted on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours. The experiments revealed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) with minimal data (7,000 samples) and a low cost ($42), significantly outperforming larger, more resource-intensive approaches. However, challenges such as optimization instability and length constraints were observed with prolonged training. The study highlights that mixing easier and harder problems and using cosine rewards can stabilize training and control output length. Despite limitations like insufficient length limits for extremely hard problems and potential multilingual drift, the findings demonstrate RL's viability for developing cost-effective, reasoning-capable LLMs, paving the way for wider accessibility.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reinforcement learning (RL) can significantly improve reasoning in small LLMs (1.5B parameters) under strict resource constraints (4 GPUs, 24 hours).\n*   The approach achieved notable performance gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) using only 7,000 samples and costing $42, demonstrating cost-effectiveness compared to large-scale methods.\n*   Mixing easier and harder problems and using cosine rewards helped stabilize training and control output length, though challenges like length limitations for complex tasks persist.\n*   The developed models (Open-RS variants) achieved competitive reasoning performance, with one variant surpassing o1-preview on the AIME24 benchmark.\n*   The study contributes open-source code and datasets, offering a practical framework for developing scalable, reasoning-capable LLMs in resource-limited environments.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small language models (LLMs) under strict computational constraints, aiming for state-of-the-art performance. Researchers adapted the GRPO algorithm and curated a high-quality, compact mathematical reasoning dataset for a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Training was conducted on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours. The findings demonstrate that RL can rapidly improve reasoning, with AMC23 accuracy rising from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, surpassing the o1-preview model. This was achieved with only 7,000 samples and a training cost of approximately $42, significantly less than thousands of dollars for baseline models. However, challenges like optimization instability and length constraints emerged with prolonged training. The research highlights the efficacy of RL for small LLMs, offering a cost-effective and accessible alternative to large-scale approaches, and releases code and datasets to foster further research.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reinforcement learning (RL) can significantly boost the reasoning performance of small LLMs (1.5B parameters) under severe resource constraints (4 GPUs, 24 hours).\n*   The study achieved state-of-the-art reasoning on AIME24 (46.7% accuracy), outperforming o1-preview, with a minimal training cost of $42 and only 7,000 samples.\n*   Early reasoning gains (within 50-100 steps) are rapid, but prolonged training can lead to performance degradation and instability, particularly with strict length constraints.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems and using cosine rewards for length control showed promise in stabilizing training and improving efficiency.\n*   The approach offers a cost-effective and data-efficient alternative to resource-intensive methods used for large LLMs.",
