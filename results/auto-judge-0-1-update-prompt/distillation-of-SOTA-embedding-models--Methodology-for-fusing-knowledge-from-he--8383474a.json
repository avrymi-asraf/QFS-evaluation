SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a novel multi-stage knowledge distillation framework designed to fuse knowledge from heterogeneous, state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding models into a smaller student model. The primary challenge addressed is the high parameter count and vector dimensionality of SOTA embedding models, which hinder real-world applications. Jasper tackles this by progressively distilling knowledge from multiple teacher models (specifically NV-Embed-v2 and Stella) using three carefully designed losses: cosine loss for direct representation alignment, similarity loss for text-pair semantic consistency, and relative similarity distillation loss for ranking preference learning. To manage the increased vector dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher outputs, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed for effective dimension reduction. The framework also includes a stage for unlocking multimodal capabilities by aligning visual and textual embeddings via self-distillation. Jasper, with 2 billion parameters, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, significantly outperforming other models in its size class.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a multi-stage distillation framework with three distinct loss functions (cosine, similarity, and relative similarity) to effectively transfer knowledge from multiple SOTA teacher embedding models.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized to reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model, addressing a key challenge of using large teacher models.\n*   The distillation process is structured in four stages, progressively transferring knowledge and reducing dimensionality, with an additional stage for multimodal alignment.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) demonstrates performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, showcasing the efficacy of the proposed heterogeneous teacher distillation methodology.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper presents Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, developed through a multi-stage knowledge distillation framework to learn from multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models, specifically NV-Embed-v2 and Stella. The distillation process utilizes three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (Lcosine) for direct vector alignment, similarity loss (Lsim) for semantic matching between text pairs, and relative similarity distillation loss (Lresim) to capture ranking preferences. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from these teachers, with Stage 1 training only a mapping layer and Stage 2 additionally training the student model's encoder layers. Stage 3 addresses the challenge of high vector dimensionality (12,288) resulting from teacher concatenation by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) through additional fully connected layers to achieve dimension reduction, while still utilizing Lsim and Lresim. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by training a vision encoder using self-distillation on image-caption pairs. Jasper achieves a high average score of 71.54 on the MTEB leaderboard, comparable to 7B parameter models, demonstrating the effectiveness of this methodology for fusing knowledge from heterogeneous teacher models.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces a novel multi-stage knowledge distillation framework designed to fuse knowledge from heterogeneous, state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding models into a smaller student model. The primary goal is to create efficient embedding models that retain the performance of larger, more resource-intensive models. The distillation process involves three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss, which progressively capture different aspects of the teacher models' representations. The framework includes stages for initial distillation from multiple teacher models (NV-Embed-v2, Stella_en_1.5B_v5) and a subsequent stage for dimension reduction using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to achieve practical vector sizes. A final stage unlocks multimodal capabilities by aligning visual and textual embeddings through self-distillation. The resulting 2B parameter Jasper model, built upon Stella, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of this heterogeneous teacher distillation methodology.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The proposed method distills knowledge from multiple SOTA embedding models into a smaller student model using a multi-stage framework.\n*   A combination of cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss is used to capture diverse representational aspects from teachers.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed for effective dimension reduction of the student model's embeddings.\n*   The 2B parameter Jasper model achieves performance comparable to larger 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark.\n*   A final stage incorporates self-distillation to enable multimodal (vision-language) capabilities.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a novel 2 billion parameter embedding model, achieving state-of-the-art performance at its scale and comparable results to 7B models on the MTEB leaderboard. The methodology focuses on distilling knowledge from heterogeneous, larger teacher models, specifically NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5. This distillation is achieved through a multi-stage framework utilizing three carefully designed losses: Lcosine (aligning absolute text representations), Lsim (measuring semantic discrepancies from a text-pair perspective), and Lresim (leveraging relative ranking information). Stages 1 and 2 focus on this multi-teacher distillation, progressively training more parameters. Stage 3 employs Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to effectively reduce vector dimensionality, using Lsim and Lresim with a self-distillation approach. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by aligning visual and textual embeddings through self-distillation using image-caption pairs. Jasper's success demonstrates the efficacy of this multi-stage distillation approach for creating compact yet powerful embedding models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A multi-stage distillation framework uses Lcosine, Lsim, and Lresim to transfer knowledge from multiple large teacher models (NV-Embed-v2, Stella_en_1.5B_v5) to a smaller student model.\n*   Stage 3 utilizes Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for effective dimension reduction, incorporating self-distillation.\n*   Stage 4 focuses on multimodal alignment by distilling visual encoder outputs using text embeddings as teachers.\n*   The resulting Jasper model (2B parameters) achieves strong performance on the MTEB benchmark, comparable to 7B models.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper details a novel multi-stage knowledge distillation framework for creating smaller, efficient text embedding models by learning from multiple larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models. The core methodology involves three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (matching semantic discrepancies from a text-pair perspective), and relative similarity distillation loss (leveraging relative ranking information). The process is structured in four stages. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from teacher models (specifically NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5), progressively training more parameters of the student model. Stage 3 addresses the challenge of high dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher vectors by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers to reduce vector dimensions, using similarity losses. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by using image-caption pairs for self-distillation to align visual and textual embeddings. Implementation details highlight the use of the Stella embedding model as a base for the 2B Jasper model, trained with specific hyperparameters and hardware. The Jasper model achieved No.3 on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating performance comparable to 7B models and significantly outperforming other 2B models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A multi-stage distillation framework uses three losses (cosine, similarity, relative similarity) to transfer knowledge from multiple SOTA teacher embedding models to a smaller student model.\n*   Stage 3 employs Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to effectively reduce the high dimensionality of the student model's concatenated teacher vectors.\n*   Stage 4 focuses on multimodal alignment through self-distillation using image-caption pairs.\n*   The resulting Jasper model (2B parameters, based on Stella) achieved a top-3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, matching 7B model performance and surpassing other 2B models.\n*   Implementation details cover the choice of teacher models (NV-Embed-v2, Stella_en_1.5B_v5), training data, and hyperparameters for each stage.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper presents a novel multi-stage knowledge distillation framework designed to fuse knowledge from heterogeneous, state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding models into a smaller student model. The approach addresses the challenge of deploying large, high-dimensional embedding models in real-world scenarios by creating a more efficient student model, Jasper. The distillation process involves three carefully designed losses: cosine loss for aligning absolute text representations, similarity loss for capturing semantic matching from a text-pair perspective, and relative similarity distillation loss to leverage ranking information. This multi-stage distillation allows the student model to learn from multiple teacher models, such as NV-Embed-v2 and Stella, by concatenating their outputs. To manage the resulting high dimensionality, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed for effective dimension reduction. Jasper, built upon the Stella embedding model with 2 billion parameters, achieves a competitive position on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating performance comparable to larger 7B parameter models while significantly outperforming similarly sized models. The framework also includes a stage for unlocking multimodal potential through self-distillation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A multi-stage distillation framework is proposed to fuse knowledge from multiple SOTA teacher embedding models into a smaller student model.\n*   Three specific loss functions (cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss) are used to guide the distillation process, moving from specific to broader semantic alignment.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is integrated for effective dimension reduction of the student model's embeddings.\n*   The resulting 2B parameter Jasper model achieves performance comparable to larger 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark.\n*   The methodology enables the creation of efficient embedding models by leveraging knowledge from larger, more resource-intensive teachers without requiring supervised data for distillation.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, developed through a novel multi-stage distillation framework that fuses knowledge from heterogeneous state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models, specifically NV-Embed-v2 and Stella. The distillation process employs three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (ensuring consistent semantic matching between text pairs), and relative similarity distillation loss (leveraging relative ranking information). Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from these larger teachers, progressively training more of the student model's parameters. Stage 3 addresses the challenge of high vector dimensionality, a common issue with SOTA models, by using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to effectively reduce dimensions, while still leveraging the distillation losses. Stage 4 aims to unlock multimodal potential by aligning visual embeddings with textual embeddings through a self-distillation mechanism. On the MTEB leaderboard, Jasper achieved the No. 3 position with an average score of 71.54 across 56 datasets, demonstrating performance comparable to 7B parameter models and significantly outperforming other models in its parameter class.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper uses a multi-stage distillation process with cosine, similarity, and relative similarity losses to learn from multiple SOTA teacher models (NV-Embed-v2, Stella).\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed in Stage 3 for effective dimension reduction of the student model's embeddings.\n*   Stage 4 focuses on initial multimodal alignment using self-distillation for vision-language capabilities.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieved a high ranking on the MTEB leaderboard, comparable to 7B models, demonstrating efficient knowledge fusion.",

The methodology focuses on fusing knowledge from heterogeneous, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models like NV-Embed-v2 and Stella. The distillation process utilizes three carefully designed losses: cosine loss for absolute representation alignment, similarity loss for semantic matching between text pairs, and relative similarity distillation loss to capture ranking preferences. Initially, in Stages 1 and 2, these losses are used to align the student model's output with concatenated teacher vectors. Stage 3 addresses the high dimensionality resulting from teacher concatenation by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to reduce vector dimensions, using only similarity-based losses. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by using self-distillation to align visual embeddings with textual ones. Jasper achieved a No.3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating performance comparable to 7B parameter models, highlighting the effectiveness of this multi-teacher distillation approach for creating smaller, high-performing embedding models.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces a novel multi-stage knowledge distillation framework designed to enable smaller student embedding models to learn from multiple larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models. The methodology addresses the practical challenges of deploying large embedding models, such as high parameter counts and vector dimensionality, which hinder real-world applications. The proposed framework utilizes three carefully designed losses: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss, to progressively transfer knowledge from teachers to the student. To further optimize for practical use, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed to effectively reduce the student model's vector dimensionality. The resulting Jasper model, with 2 billion parameters, achieves performance comparable to 7 billion parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating the efficacy of this distillation approach. The paper also details a stage for unlocking multimodal potential by integrating a vision encoder.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Proposes a multi-stage distillation framework with three novel loss functions (cosine, similarity, relative similarity) to transfer knowledge from multiple SOTA teacher models to a smaller student model.\n*   Employs Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for effective reduction of the student model's vector dimensionality.\n*   The 2B Jasper model achieves performance comparable to larger 7B models on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating efficient knowledge transfer.\n*   Includes a stage for multimodal learning by integrating and aligning a vision encoder with textual embeddings.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces a novel multi-stage knowledge distillation framework designed to enable smaller student embedding models to learn from multiple larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models. The methodology addresses the practical challenges of deploying large embedding models, such as high parameter counts and vector dimensionality, which hinder real-world applications. The proposed framework utilizes three carefully designed losses: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss, to progressively transfer knowledge from teachers to the student. To further optimize for practical use, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed to effectively reduce the student model's vector dimensionality. The resulting Jasper model, with 2 billion parameters, achieves performance comparable to 7 billion parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating the efficacy of this distillation approach. The paper also details a stage for unlocking multimodal potential by integrating a vision encoder.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Proposes a multi-stage distillation framework with three novel loss functions (cosine, similarity, relative similarity) to transfer knowledge from multiple SOTA teacher models to a smaller student model.\n*   Employs Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for effective reduction of the student model's vector dimensionality.\n*   The 2B Jasper model achieves performance comparable to larger 7B models on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating efficient knowledge transfer.\n*   Includes a stage for multimodal learning by integrating and aligning a vision encoder with textual embeddings.",
