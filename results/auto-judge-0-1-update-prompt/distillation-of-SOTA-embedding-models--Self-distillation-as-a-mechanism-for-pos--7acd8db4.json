SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a novel 2 billion parameter embedding model, developed through a multi-stage distillation framework designed to transfer knowledge from multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models. The core of this process is a self-distillation mechanism that allows a smaller student model to learn from larger, more powerful models. This distillation is achieved using three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss for absolute representation alignment, similarity loss for semantic consistency between text pairs, and relative similarity distillation loss to preserve ranking preferences. To address the challenge of high vector dimensionality in SOTA models, the framework also incorporates Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for effective dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, a self-distillation approach is employed in the final stage to align visual embeddings with textual embeddings, enabling multimodal capabilities. Jasper achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, significantly outperforming other models in its parameter class.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper utilizes a multi-stage distillation process to transfer knowledge from multiple SOTA teacher embedding models to a smaller student model.\n*   The distillation employs three loss functions (cosine loss, similarity loss, relative similarity distillation loss) to guide the learning process.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is used for effective dimensionality reduction of the student model's embeddings.\n*   A self-distillation mechanism is applied for preliminary multimodal alignment between text and image embeddings.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art performance by distilling knowledge from multiple larger, teacher embedding models. The core of this distillation process involves three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (capturing semantic discrepancies from a pair perspective), and relative similarity distillation loss (leveraging relative ranking). To address the high dimensionality of concatenated teacher embeddings, the authors employ Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) through additional fully connected layers, enabling effective dimension reduction to 512 dimensions. A novel self-distillation approach is also proposed for dimension reduction, where intermediate student embeddings act as teachers. Furthermore, Stage 4 of the training focuses on unlocking multimodal potential by using image-caption pairs for self-distillation to align visual and textual embeddings. Jasper's performance on the MTEB leaderboard, achieving the No. 3 position, demonstrates its effectiveness, offering comparable results to 7B parameter models while significantly outperforming other models in its size class.\n\n2.

The core of the framework is a multi-stage distillation process designed to transfer knowledge from multiple larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher embedding models to a smaller student model. This process utilizes three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. These losses progressively guide the student model to align its text representations with those of the teachers, moving from specific vector differences to broader semantic and ranking similarities. To address the challenge of high dimensionality in teacher models, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed to effectively reduce the student model's vector dimensionality. Furthermore, a self-distillation mechanism is used in a fourth stage to align visual embeddings with textual embeddings, enabling multimodal capabilities. Jasper achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating the efficacy of this distillation approach for post-hoc modality alignment and creating efficient, high-performing embedding models.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper details the development of the Jasper embedding model, a 2B parameter model that achieves state-of-the-art performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). The core of its development lies in a multi-stage distillation framework designed to transfer knowledge from multiple larger teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5) to a smaller student model. Stages 1 and 2 focus on this knowledge distillation using three carefully designed losses: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. Stage 3 addresses the challenge of high vector dimensionality, introduced by concatenating teacher embeddings, by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to reduce dimensions. Stage 4 explores multimodal capabilities by integrating a vision encoder and using self-distillation to align image and text embeddings. Implementation details highlight the use of specific datasets, hardware, and training configurations across the four stages. Jasper demonstrates robustness to instruction variations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper utilizes a four-stage distillation process to learn from multiple SOTA teacher models, focusing on knowledge transfer, dimension reduction, and multimodal alignment.\n*   The distillation employs three distinct loss functions (cosine, similarity, and relative similarity) to effectively transfer knowledge from teacher to student models.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is used in Stage 3 to reduce the high dimensionality of the student model's embeddings after concatenating teacher outputs.\n*   Stage 4 introduces self-distillation for preliminary visual-textual alignment using image-caption pairs.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, showcasing significant efficiency gains.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art performance by distilling knowledge from multiple larger teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5). The distillation process, spanning four stages, employs three carefully designed losses: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss, progressing from specific to broader semantic alignment. Stage 1 and 2 focus on this multi-teacher distillation, with Stage 2 fine-tuning more student parameters. Stage 3 addresses the challenge of high vector dimensionality (12,288 dimensions after concatenation) by using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers to generate lower-dimensional embeddings (e.g., 512-D), leveraging self-distillation where earlier student outputs act as teachers. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by aligning image and text embeddings using a vision encoder and a self-distillation mechanism with image-caption pairs, though this stage is noted as preliminary. Jasper's implementation details include specific hyperparameters, GPUs, and training schedules. On the MTEB benchmark, Jasper ranks third, matching 7B models and outperforming other 2B models. The model also demonstrates robustness to different instructions.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model that leverages a multi-stage distillation framework to learn from multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models. The distillation process employs three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss, progressing from specific to broader semantic alignment. To address the challenge of high vector dimensionality in SOTA models, Jasper incorporates Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) in Stage 3, enabling effective dimension reduction. Stage 4 further enhances Jasper by incorporating a vision encoder and a self-distillation mechanism for preliminary multimodal alignment, using text captions as teacher signals for image embeddings. Jasper's architecture combines a language model with a vision encoder. The implementation details outline the training stages, datasets, and hyperparameters. Jasper achieved the No. 3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating performance comparable to 7B parameter models and significantly outperforming other models in its size class. The model also exhibits robustness to instruction variations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a multi-stage distillation process using cosine, similarity, and relative similarity losses to learn from multiple large teacher embedding models.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized for effective vector dimensionality reduction in Stage 3.\n*   A self-distillation mechanism in Stage 4 aligns image embeddings with text embeddings for multimodal capabilities.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieved comparable performance to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, securing the No. 3 position.\n*   Jasper demonstrates robustness to different instructions, indicating its ability to understand varied task prompts.",

The core of the approach is to distill knowledge from multiple larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding models. This distillation process is guided by three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss, which progressively transfer knowledge from specific to broader semantic relationships. To address the challenge of high vector dimensionality common in SOTA models, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed in Stage 3 for effective dimension reduction, allowing the student model to output vectors at various dimensions. Stage 4 focuses on unlocking multimodal capabilities by aligning visual embeddings with textual embeddings through a self-distillation mechanism, using image-caption pairs. The Jasper model, built upon Stella and incorporating a vision encoder, achieved the No. 3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating performance comparable to much larger 7B parameter models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper utilizes a multi-stage distillation process to transfer knowledge from multiple larger teacher embedding models (Stella, NV-Embed-v2) to a smaller student model.\n*   Three distinct loss functions (cosine loss, similarity loss, relative similarity distillation loss) are employed to capture different aspects of semantic alignment during distillation.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is used in Stage 3 for effective dimension reduction, allowing the student model to output embeddings at various, more manageable dimensions.\n*   Stage 4 implements a self-distillation mechanism to align visual and textual embeddings, enabling multimodal capabilities.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models, ranking No. 3 on the MTEB leaderboard.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, developed using a multi-stage distillation framework to learn from multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models. The framework employs three carefully designed losses (cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss) to transfer knowledge from larger teachers to the smaller student model. To address the challenge of high vector dimensionality from concatenating teacher outputs, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized for effective dimension reduction. Stage 4 of the training process focuses on unlocking multimodal potential through self-distillation, where text embeddings act as teachers for image embeddings. This stage aims for preliminary visual-language alignment, though the authors acknowledge limitations in the current vision encoding and suggest future improvements. Jasper achieves comparable performance to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of this distillation approach for post-hoc modality alignment and efficient knowledge transfer.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper utilizes a multi-stage distillation process with three distinct loss functions to learn from multiple SOTA embedding models.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed for effective dimension reduction of the student model's embeddings.\n*   Stage 4 specifically uses self-distillation, with text embeddings as teachers for image embeddings, to achieve preliminary multimodal alignment.\n*   The Jasper model, despite its 2B parameters, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark.\n*   The paper acknowledges limitations in the current vision encoding and suggests future work to enhance multimodal capabilities.",
