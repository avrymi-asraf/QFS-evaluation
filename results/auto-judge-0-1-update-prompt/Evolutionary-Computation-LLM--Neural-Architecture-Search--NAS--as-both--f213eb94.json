SUMMARY:\nThis paper explores the synergistic relationship between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), positioning Neural Architecture Search (NAS) as a key area where this collaboration thrives. From the perspective of NAS, LLMs can be seen as both a target for optimization and a domain where EAs can provide synergistic benefits. EAs are instrumental in automating and refining the search for optimal neural architectures, a process that is otherwise complex and time-consuming. LLMs, in turn, contribute their vast knowledge and generative capabilities to this search. They can act as intelligent components within EA frameworks, guiding the exploration of the architecture space, generating candidate architectures, and even serving as performance predictors. Conversely, NAS itself can be viewed as a method to optimize LLM architectures, leading to more efficient and specialized models. The paper details how LLMs' representation and code generation abilities, combined with EA's iterative search, enable sophisticated NAS, leading to improved model performance and reduced computational costs.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   EAs automate and optimize the search for neural architectures (NAS), while LLMs provide domain knowledge and generative capabilities to enhance this search.\n*   LLMs can be optimized through NAS techniques, leading to more efficient and tailored LLM architectures.\n*   LLMs contribute to NAS by encoding architectures, predicting performance, and generating candidate structures, often within an EA framework.\n*   The synergy allows for exploring a wider range of architectures and discovering novel designs that would be difficult to find manually.\n*   This collaboration between EAs and LLMs in NAS aims to improve both the efficiency of the search process and the performance of the resulting neural architectures.",

LLMs are identified as crucial for NAS by providing representation capabilities, code generation, and reasoning. For instance, GPT-NAS and LLMatic leverage LLMs to encode architectures and generate code for NAS. AutoTinyBERT exemplifies how LLMs can reduce the search space complexity for NAS. ReStruct utilizes LLM reasoning to discover meta-structures. AutoBERT-Zero demonstrates LLMs assisting in discovering new LLM backbones. LLMatic employs CodeGen for evolutionary crossover and mutation, while Guided Evolution uses LLMs for architecture code mutation and crossover, with EA selection methods like SPEA-2 and NSGA-II. The paper highlights how LLMs enhance EAs in NAS by providing prior knowledge and facilitating more intelligent search, while EAs provide a robust optimization framework.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs significantly contribute to NAS by encoding architectures (GPT-NAS), generating architecture code (LLMatic, Guided Evolution), and providing reasoning capabilities (ReStruct).\n*   AutoTinyBERT showcases how LLMs can aid in reducing the search space for NAS, transforming it from exponential to linear.\n*   LLMatic utilizes CodeGen for evolutionary crossover and mutation operations within NAS, while Guided Evolution uses LLMs for architecture code mutation and crossover, guided by EA selection methods like SPEA-2 and NSGA-II.\n*   AutoBERT-Zero leverages LLMs to discover new LLM backbones from scratch.\n*   ReStruct employs LLM reasoning to discover meta-structures in heterogeneous networks.",

SUMMARY:\nThis survey explores the synergistic relationship between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), positioning both as optimization targets and domains for collaboration. LLMs can enhance EAs by providing domain knowledge and improving search operators, while EAs can optimize LLMs through techniques like prompt engineering and neural architecture search (NAS). The paper details how LLMs can act as black-box optimizers, generating solutions and even optimization algorithms themselves, thereby improving EA efficiency. Conversely, EAs offer a powerful framework for fine-tuning LLM prompts and discovering optimal LLM architectures, leading to more capable and efficient models. The synergy is further exemplified in applications like code generation, software engineering, and NAS, where EAs provide the iterative search framework and LLMs contribute intelligent evolutionary operations. The roadmap suggests future research directions focusing on improving LLM-assisted optimization for complex problems, developing more intelligent EAs guided by LLMs, and robust prompt engineering.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs can act as black-box optimizers and generate optimization algorithms, enhancing EA capabilities.\n*   EAs can optimize LLM prompts and architectures, improving LLM performance and efficiency.\n*   The synergy between LLMs and EAs is crucial for advancements in areas like Neural Architecture Search (NAS), code generation, and software engineering.\n*   Future research should focus on making LLM-assisted optimization more robust for complex, large-scale problems and exploring new collaborative paradigms beyond current prompt engineering and NAS applications.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper explores the symbiotic relationship between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), positioning NAS as a key application area for their combined strengths. EAs can optimize LLMs by acting as black-box optimizers for prompt engineering and by searching for optimal neural architectures (EA-enhanced LLM). Conversely, LLMs can enhance EAs by providing domain knowledge to guide searches, generating optimization algorithms, and facilitating EA application in text-based domains (LLM-enhanced EA). The synergy is evident in applications like code generation, where LLMs can generate initial code or intelligent mutation operators, while EAs refine and evolve it. In NAS, LLMs can encode architectures for EA optimization or generate code for architecture search, leading to more efficient and effective model design. The paper highlights how this integrated synergy drives advancements across various domains, with NAS being a prime example of how EAs can optimize LLM architectures and LLMs can inform EA search strategies.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   EAs can optimize LLM prompts and architectures, enhancing LLM performance.\n*   LLMs can enhance EAs by providing domain knowledge and generating optimization operators.\n*   The synergy between LLMs and EAs is particularly impactful in Neural Architecture Search (NAS), where EAs optimize LLM architectures and LLMs guide EA search.\n*   In code generation, LLMs can generate initial code or intelligent mutation operators, which EAs then refine and evolve.\n*   LLM-assisted black-box optimization and EA-based prompt engineering are key areas where EAs improve LLM capabilities.",

LLMs can enhance EAs by providing domain knowledge and improving search operators, while EAs can optimize LLMs, particularly in black-box settings like prompt engineering and neural architecture search (NAS). The synergy is categorized into LLM-enhanced EA and EA-enhanced LLM. Specifically, LLMs can act as sophisticated search operators in black-box optimization, improving solution generation. Conversely, EAs are crucial for optimizing LLM prompts and architectures, enabling more efficient and tailored LLM performance. In NAS, LLMs contribute through representation, generation, and reasoning, guiding EA-driven architecture discovery. This collaboration is also vital for code generation, where LLMs provide code intelligence and EAs refine generated code through iterative search. The paper offers a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the need for more robust LLM-EA integrations for complex tasks like NAS and code generation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs can enhance EAs by acting as intelligent search operators in black-box optimization, while EAs can optimize LLM prompts and architectures.\n*   Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a significant application area where LLMs provide architectural knowledge and EAs drive the search for optimal designs.\n*   LLMs contribute to NAS through their representation capabilities, code generation abilities, and reasoning power, guiding EA-based architectural discovery.\n*   In code generation, LLMs offer programming understanding and generation, while EAs refine the code through evolutionary search, improving efficiency and quality.\n*   The synergy between LLMs and EAs is crucial for advancing complex tasks like NAS and code generation, with future research focusing on more robust integrations.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper surveys the synergistic relationship between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), positioning them as both optimization targets and domains for collaboration. The research categorizes this synergy into LLM-enhanced EA and EA-enhanced LLM, alongside applications driven by their combined strengths. For LLM-enhanced EA, LLMs can act as black-box optimizers or assist in generating optimization algorithms, leveraging their knowledge and generative capabilities. Conversely, EA-enhanced LLM utilizes EAs for prompt engineering and neural architecture search (NAS), improving LLM performance and efficiency. Key application areas include code generation and NAS, where EAs provide the search framework and LLMs contribute through their representation, generation, and reasoning abilities. The paper highlights how LLMs can improve EA's search by providing domain knowledge and how EAs can optimize LLMs for better performance and efficiency, particularly in complex tasks like NAS and code generation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs can enhance EAs by acting as black-box optimizers or aiding in algorithm generation, leveraging their knowledge and generative capabilities.\n*   EAs can enhance LLMs through techniques like prompt engineering and neural architecture search (NAS), improving LLM performance and efficiency.\n*   Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a significant application area where EAs provide the search framework, and LLMs contribute with their representation, generation, and reasoning abilities.\n*   Code generation is another key area where the synergy of LLMs and EAs is leveraged, with LLMs assisting in generating and evolving code, and EAs providing an iterative optimization framework.\n*   LLM-assisted black-box optimization involves using LLMs directly as search operators or to generate optimization algorithms, while EA-based prompt engineering uses EAs to discover optimal prompts for LLMs.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper surveys the synergistic relationship between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), exploring how they can enhance each other and drive advancements in various applications. From the perspective of LLM-enhanced EA, LLMs act as powerful black-box optimizers and can generate novel optimization algorithms. This includes LLM-assisted black-box optimization where LLMs improve solutions iteratively and LLM-assisted optimization algorithm generation where LLMs help design new algorithms. Conversely, EA-enhanced LLMs leverage EAs for prompt engineering (both discrete and continuous) to optimize LLM outputs and for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to discover more efficient LLM architectures. The paper details applications of this synergy, including code generation where LLMs provide intelligent mutation operators for EAs, and NAS where EAs search for optimal network designs guided by LLM capabilities. The research categorizes these interactions into LLM-enhanced EA, EA-enhanced LLM, and applications driven by integrated synergy, offering a roadmap for future research in these collaborative domains.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs can significantly enhance Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) by acting as black-box optimizers and assisting in the generation of new optimization algorithms.\n*   Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) can improve Large Language Models (LLMs) through sophisticated prompt engineering and by automating the search for optimal neural architectures (NAS).\n*   The synergy between LLMs and EAs is particularly impactful in domains like code generation, where LLMs provide intelligent operators for EA-driven search.\n*   Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a key application area where EAs explore architectural spaces, with LLMs contributing knowledge and generation capabilities to guide the search.\n*   Prompt engineering, both discrete and continuous, is a major avenue for EA to enhance LLM performance by optimizing input instructions.",

It frames LLMs as both a target for optimization and a domain for synergy with EAs. The core of the review lies in the reciprocal inspiration between these two powerful AI paradigms. EAs can enhance LLMs through techniques like prompt engineering and neural architecture search, optimizing LLM performance and efficiency. Conversely, LLMs can significantly boost EAs by providing domain knowledge, improving search operators, and even generating novel optimization algorithms. The paper details how LLM-assisted black-box optimization leverages LLMs within EA frameworks, and how EA-based prompt engineering and LLM architecture search refine LLM capabilities. It further explores applications where this synergy is crucial, with a particular emphasis on code generation, demonstrating how combined strengths lead to more robust and intelligent solutions. The roadmap suggests continued exploration into complex optimization, robust prompt engineering, and generalized applications for both LLMs and EAs.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs can be optimized by EAs (e.g., prompt engineering, architecture search), and EAs can be enhanced by LLMs (e.g., better search operators, algorithm generation).\n*   LLM-assisted black-box optimization utilizes LLMs within EA frameworks to improve search processes.\n*   EA-based prompt engineering and EA-based LLM architecture search are key methods for enhancing LLM performance.\n*   The synergy between LLMs and EAs is particularly impactful in application domains like code generation, leading to more intelligent and efficient outcomes.\n*   Future research directions include tackling complex optimization, improving prompt stability, and generalizing NAS.",
