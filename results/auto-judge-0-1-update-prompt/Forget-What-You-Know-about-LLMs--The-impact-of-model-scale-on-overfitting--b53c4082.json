SUMMARY:\nThis research introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify overfitting in Large Language Models (LLMs) by systematically distorting benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic content and labels. The study found that many LLMs, particularly larger ones, exhibit a significant drop in performance when faced with rephrased questions, indicating an overreliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. This phenomenon is more pronounced in models with higher baseline accuracy, suggesting that excellent performance on standard benchmarks may mask underlying vulnerabilities. The Llama family of models and those with lower baseline accuracy showed less degradation, implying reduced dependency on superficial patterns. The findings challenge the community to move beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation, suggesting that model scale and initial accuracy can be indicators of overfitting vulnerability.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n* Larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to prompt rephrasing, indicating a higher vulnerability to overfitting on benchmark-specific patterns.\n* Models with higher baseline accuracy on original benchmarks often exhibit larger performance declines when tested with perturbed prompts.\n* The Llama family of models demonstrated greater resilience to prompt variations compared to other models of similar scale.\n* Performance degradation under rephrasing suggests that high benchmark scores may not always reflect true language understanding but rather memorization of specific prompt formats.\n* The C-BOD framework highlights a potential paradox where models excelling on standard evaluations may be more susceptible to subtle changes in prompt wording.",

C-BOD systematically rephrases benchmark questions while preserving their semantic meaning, then evaluates model performance on both original and rephrased versions. The study found that most LLMs exhibit a significant performance degradation when faced with these rephrased prompts, indicating a reliance on surface-level cues rather than true language understanding. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more vulnerable to this overfitting. In contrast, the Llama family of models demonstrated greater resilience, showing minimal performance drops. The average accuracy decline across all models was 2.15%, with models showing statistically significant differences experiencing a 2.72% drop. These findings challenge the reliability of standard benchmark evaluations and highlight the need for more robust assessment methods that prioritize generalization.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD) framework, designed to identify how heavily Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on specific prompt patterns within benchmarks, a form of overfitting. By rephrasing benchmark questions while preserving their semantic meaning, C-BOD exposes LLMs that achieve high scores by memorizing surface cues rather than demonstrating true language understanding. The study found that larger LLMs tend to be more vulnerable to these rephrasing perturbations, exhibiting a significant performance degradation. This suggests that increased model scale can correlate with a greater reliance on fixed prompt patterns. Conversely, models with lower baseline accuracy, such as the Llama family, showed less performance degradation, indicating greater resilience. The research highlights a paradox where high benchmark accuracy might mask underlying overfitting issues, urging a shift towards evaluating LLM robustness and generalization beyond leaderboard scores.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThe Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD) framework was developed to assess how susceptible Large Language Models (LLMs) are to overfitting on benchmark-specific surface cues. By systematically rephrasing benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic meaning, C-BOD exposes LLMs that rely on memorized patterns rather than true language understanding. The study found that a significant majority of leading LLMs exhibit performance degradation when faced with these rephrased prompts, indicating a widespread issue of overfitting. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy tended to be more vulnerable to these perturbations. Conversely, the Llama family of models demonstrated greater resilience, showing less performance degradation. This research suggests that high scores on standard benchmarks may not always reflect robust generalization, highlighting the need for evaluation methods that test for resilience to prompt variations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy are more prone to overfitting benchmark-specific cues, showing greater performance drops when prompts are rephrased.\n*   The Llama family of models demonstrated resilience to prompt rephrasing, indicating a reduced dependency on superficial patterns compared to other models.\n*   The C-BOD framework reveals that many LLMs achieve high benchmark scores by exploiting surface-level patterns rather than through genuine language understanding.\n*   The study's findings challenge the reliability of leaderboard scores alone, advocating for evaluations that prioritize robustness and generalization.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to expose LLMs' reliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. By systematically rephrasing benchmark prompts while preserving semantic content, C-BOD detects overfitting. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs revealed an average performance degradation of 2.15% under modest rephrasing, with 20 models showing statistically significant drops. Crucially, larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy tended to be more sensitive to these rephrasings, indicating a potential overreliance on fixed prompt patterns. In contrast, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy demonstrated less degradation, suggesting greater resilience. The framework's dataset- and model-agnostic design allows for integration into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding, challenging the community to prioritize generalization over leaderboard scores.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Larger LLMs and models with higher baseline accuracy are more vulnerable to overfitting on benchmark-specific prompt patterns.\n*   The C-BOD framework uses prompt rephrasing to detect LLMs' overreliance on superficial cues, revealing an average 2.15% accuracy drop across 26 models.\n*   The Llama family of models demonstrated greater resilience to prompt rephrasing compared to many other LLMs.\n*   C-BOD is dataset and model-agnostic, enabling its integration into training to foster more robust language understanding.\n*   While effective for surface-level overfitting, C-BOD has limitations in detecting deeper forms of overfitting and can increase computational costs during training integration.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify overfitting in Large Language Models (LLMs) by systematically rephrasing benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic content. The study reveals that many LLMs over-rely on surface-level cues from widely used benchmarks like MMLU, leading to significant performance degradation when these prompts are subtly altered. Notably, the research found a correlation between model scale and overfitting vulnerability; larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to rephrasing, exhibiting greater performance drops. Similarly, models with higher baseline accuracy on original benchmarks also show a tendency to underperform more significantly when faced with perturbed prompts, suggesting their high scores might be due to memorization rather than true generalization. In contrast, the Llama family of models demonstrated notable resilience to these perturbations, indicating a reduced dependency on superficial patterns. The C-BOD framework is presented as a valuable tool for the LLM community to move beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize robust language understanding.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Larger LLMs tend to be more vulnerable to overfitting, showing greater performance degradation when benchmark prompts are rephrased.\n*   Models with higher baseline accuracy on standard benchmarks are also more likely to experience significant performance drops when exposed to prompt variations.\n*   The Llama family of models demonstrated resilience to prompt rephrasing, suggesting a lower dependency on superficial cues compared to other models.\n*   The C-BOD framework systematically rephrases prompts to expose LLM over-reliance on specific phrasing, revealing that high benchmark scores can mask overfitting.\n*   C-BOD's primary limitation is its focus on textual rephrasing, potentially overlooking deeper forms of overfitting, and the computational cost of integrating it into training pipelines.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD) framework, designed to assess how reliant Large Language Models (LLMs) are on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. C-BOD systematically perturbs benchmark prompts while preserving semantic meaning and labels to reveal overfitting. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs showed that most models experienced a performance degradation of 2.15% on average after modest rephrasing. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy tended to be more vulnerable to these perturbations, indicating a greater reliance on fixed prompt patterns. Conversely, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy demonstrated more resilience, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues. The framework's dataset- and model-agnostic design allows for integration into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding, challenging the community to look beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize generalization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy are generally more susceptible to overfitting on benchmark-specific cues, showing greater performance degradation when prompts are rephrased.\n*   The Llama family of models demonstrated resilience to prompt rephrasing, indicating a reduced reliance on superficial patterns compared to many other LLMs.\n*   A significant correlation exists between a model's original accuracy and its vulnerability to prompt perturbations, suggesting high scores might mask an overreliance on specific prompt structures.\n*   The C-BOD framework effectively identifies overfitting by quantifying performance drops due to systematic prompt rephrasing, highlighting a gap in traditional LLM evaluation methods.\n*   While effective, C-BOD's primary limitation is its focus on textual rephrasing, potentially overlooking deeper forms of overfitting, and the computational cost of integrating it into training.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD) to assess how LLMs rely on specific surface cues in benchmark prompts, rather than true language understanding. The C-BOD framework systematically rephrases benchmark questions while preserving semantic content and labels, then measures performance degradation. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs revealed that most models exhibit a performance drop (average 2.15%) when faced with these rephrased prompts, indicating overfitting. Notably, larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to these rephrasings, showing a log-linear increase in performance difference with model size. Similarly, models with higher baseline accuracy also experienced larger performance declines, suggesting a reliance on benchmark-specific patterns. In contrast, the Llama family of models demonstrated greater resilience, with minimal degradation, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues. The study highlights that high benchmark scores may mask underlying vulnerabilities, urging a shift towards evaluating LLM robustness and generalization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Larger LLMs tend to be more vulnerable to overfitting on benchmark-specific prompt patterns, showing a logarithmic increase in performance degradation with scale.\n*   Models with higher baseline accuracy on standard benchmarks are also more likely to experience significant performance drops when prompts are rephrased, indicating reliance on surface cues.\n*   The Llama family of models demonstrated resilience to prompt rephrasing, suggesting a reduced dependency on superficial patterns compared to other models.\n*   C-BOD reveals that a significant portion of high LLM benchmark scores may be attributed to memorization of prompt structures rather than true language understanding.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD) framework to evaluate how LLMs overfit to specific benchmark prompts by introducing controlled textual distortions. The study found that larger LLMs tend to be more vulnerable to overfitting, exhibiting greater performance degradation when prompts are rephrased, suggesting a reliance on superficial cues. Conversely, models with lower baseline accuracy and the Llama family demonstrated greater resilience to these perturbations. The C-BOD framework revealed that high performance on standard benchmarks can mask an overreliance on specific prompt patterns rather than true language understanding. The average performance drop across 26 leading LLMs was 2.15%, with 20 models showing statistically significant degradation. The research emphasizes the need to move beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize robustness and generalization in LLM evaluations. While C-BOD is effective for detecting surface-level overfitting, its limitations include potential oversight of deeper forms of overfitting and increased computational cost for integration into training pipelines. The framework and datasets are publicly available to promote reproducibility and further research.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis research introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to expose how Large Language Models (LLMs) overfit to specific benchmark prompts. By systematically rephrasing benchmark questions while preserving their meaning, C-BOD assesses whether LLM performance is driven by memorized patterns rather than true understanding. The study found that a significant number of leading LLMs (20 out of 26 tested) exhibit performance degradation when faced with these rephrased prompts, indicating a reliance on surface-level cues. Notably, larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more vulnerable to such perturbations, suggesting that impressive benchmark scores can mask an overreliance on fixed prompt patterns. In contrast, the Llama family of models and those with lower initial accuracy showed less degradation, implying greater resilience. The paper emphasizes that high leaderboard scores should be interpreted with caution, prioritizing robustness and generalization in LLM evaluations. The C-BOD framework is dataset-agnostic and its code is publicly available to encourage more reliable LLM assessment.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Larger LLMs and models with higher baseline accuracy are generally more vulnerable to overfitting on benchmark prompts, showing greater performance drops when questions are rephrased.\n*   The C-BOD framework demonstrates that many LLMs rely on surface-level cues and memorized patterns rather than true language understanding, leading to performance degradation under prompt variations.\n*   The Llama family of models exhibited resilience to prompt rephrasing, suggesting that architectural choices and training strategies can mitigate overfitting.\n*   The study highlights a paradox where high performance on standard benchmarks might mask an underlying vulnerability to prompt variations, urging a shift towards evaluating robustness and generalization.\n*   The C-BOD framework is dataset-agnostic and its code is publicly available, enabling the community to adopt more robust evaluation methods for LLMs.",
