It formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" which posits that high-level concepts are represented as linear directions within these spaces. The authors define two formalizations of linear representation: one in the output (unembedding) space, linked to measurement, and another in the input (embedding) space, linked to intervention. A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which enforces orthogonality between causally separable concepts. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for a consistent geometric interpretation. The paper demonstrates empirically with LLaMA-2 that this causal structure exists, that the proposed inner product respects semantic relationships, and that these linear representations can indeed be used for model interpretation and control. The work highlights that the standard Euclidean inner product is insufficient for capturing this semantic structure, whereas the causal inner product provides a principled way to understand and manipulate these representations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n* The paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis\" by defining linear representations in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces using counterfactuals.\n* A novel \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which enforces orthogonality between causally separable concepts.\n* This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, resolving geometric unidentifiability and enabling consistent interpretation and control.\n* Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and the effectiveness of the causal inner product in reflecting semantic structure and facilitating model manipulation.\n* The work emphasizes that the Euclidean inner product is inadequate for capturing the semantic structure of these representations, unlike the proposed causal inner product.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper addresses the \"linear representation hypothesis\" in large language models (LLMs), proposing that high-level concepts are represented linearly in the model's representation space. The authors formalize this hypothesis by defining linear representations in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces using counterfactual pairs. They demonstrate that these formalizations connect to measurement (via linear probing of unembedding representations) and intervention (via steering with embedding representations). A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product\" designed to make causally separable concepts orthogonal. This specific inner product is shown to unify the embedding and unembedding representations, resolving geometric unidentifiability issues. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear representations, the effectiveness of the causal inner product in respecting semantic structure, and the ability to use these representations for both model interpretation and control. The paper emphasizes that the choice of inner product is crucial for meaningful geometric operations on LLM representations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes linear representation in LLMs using counterfactual pairs, linking unembedding representations to measurement and embedding representations to intervention.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which treats causally separable concepts as orthogonal, thereby unifying embedding and unembedding representations and addressing geometric unidentifiability.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 confirm the existence of linear representations for concepts and demonstrate that the causal inner product captures semantic structure.\n*   The derived concept directions can be used for both interpreting LLM behavior (measurement) and controlling it (intervention).\n*   The choice of inner product is critical for making geometric notions like similarity and projection semantically meaningful in LLM representation spaces.",

The authors formalize this hypothesis by defining linear representations in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces using counterfactual pairs. They demonstrate that these formalizations correspond to the notions of \"measurement\" (using linear probes) and \"intervention\" (steering model behavior), respectively. A key challenge identified is the geometric unidentifiability of these spaces, meaning the choice of inner product is crucial and not inherently determined by model training. To resolve this, they introduce the concept of a \"causal inner product,\" which enforces orthogonality between causally separable concepts. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for a consistent geometric interpretation. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and show that the estimated causal inner product respects semantic structure, enabling effective interpretation and control.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Linear representations of concepts are formalized in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces using counterfactual pairs, linking them to measurement and intervention capabilities.\n*   The geometric unidentifiability of representation spaces is resolved by defining a \"causal inner product\" that enforces orthogonality between causally separable concepts.\n*   This causal inner product unifies embedding and unembedding representations, providing a consistent geometric framework for understanding and manipulating concepts within LLMs.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of these linear representations and the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic structure for interpretation and control.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper addresses the challenge of geometric unidentifiability in representation spaces of large language models (LLMs) by proposing a causal structure. The core idea is that high-level concepts are represented linearly within these spaces. The authors formalize \"linear representation\" in two ways: as a subspace in the \"unembedding\" (output word) space and as a subspace in the \"embedding\" (input context) space. They demonstrate that the unembedding representation connects to measurement (e.g., linear probing), while the embedding representation connects to intervention (e.g., model steering).\n\nA key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product.\" This inner product is defined such that causally separable concepts (those that can vary independently) are represented by orthogonal vectors. Crucially, this causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, meaning that in a transformed space defined by this inner product, these two notions of representation coincide. This unification is achieved through a Riesz isomorphism. The paper also provides an explicit form for this causal inner product, linking it to the covariance of word embeddings. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations, the semantic properties of the causal inner product, and its ability to connect to measurement and intervention capabilities.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes linear representations in LLMs by defining \"unembedding representations\" (in output space) and \"embedding representations\" (in input space) using counterfactual pairs.\n*   It introduces a \"causal inner product\" where causally separable concepts are orthogonal, which unifies the embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   Theorem 3.2 shows that this causal inner product acts as a Riesz isomorphism, mapping unembedding representations to their corresponding embedding representations.\n*   Theorem 3.4 provides an explicit form for the causal inner product, relating it to the covariance of word embeddings and enabling its estimation.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of these linear representations and the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic structure and enabling control.",

The authors formalize this hypothesis by defining linear representations in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces using counterfactual pairs. They demonstrate that the unembedding representation corresponds to \"measurement\" (predicting concepts via linear probes), while the embedding representation relates to \"intervention\" (controlling concepts by adding vectors). A key challenge is the geometric unidentifiability of these spaces, meaning the choice of inner product affects geometric notions like similarity and projection. The paper resolves this by introducing a \"causal inner product,\" defined by the property that causally separable concepts are orthogonal. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations and provides a principled way to define geometric operations that respect semantic structure. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic relationships and enabling controlled interventions.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes the linear representation hypothesis by defining concept representations in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces using counterfactual pairs, linking them to model measurement and intervention capabilities.\n*   Geometric notions like similarity and projection in LM representation spaces are ill-defined due to unidentifiability, which is resolved by introducing a \"causal inner product.\"\n*   A causal inner product is defined as one where causally separable concepts are represented by orthogonal vectors, thereby unifying embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   The causal inner product allows for meaningful geometric operations that respect the semantic structure of concepts, enabling more interpretable and controllable LM behavior.\n*   Empirical results with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of linear representations and show that the estimated causal inner product aligns with semantic separability and facilitates controlled interventions.",

The authors formalize this hypothesis by defining linear representations in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces using counterfactual pairs. They demonstrate that these formalizations connect to measurement (linear probing) and intervention (model steering), respectively. A core challenge identified is the geometric unidentifiability of these spaces; the choice of inner product is crucial for meaningful geometric operations like projection and similarity. To resolve this, they introduce the \"causal inner product,\" defined by the property that causally separable concepts are represented orthogonally. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for consistent interpretation and control. Empirical validation using LLaMA-2 supports the existence of these linear representations and demonstrates that the causal inner product captures semantic structure and facilitates model steering, unlike the standard Euclidean inner product.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes linear representations in language models using counterfactual pairs, linking them to measurement (probing) and intervention (steering).\n*   Geometric unidentifiability is resolved by defining a \"causal inner product\" where causally separable concepts are orthogonal.\n*   The causal inner product unifies distinct embedding and unembedding representations, enabling consistent geometric operations.\n*   Empirical results with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear representations and show the causal inner product's effectiveness in capturing semantic structure and facilitating model control.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper addresses the geometric unidentifiability of representation spaces in Large Language Models (LLMs) by formalizing the \"linear representation hypothesis\" through a causal framework. It defines linear representations in terms of counterfactual pairs for both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces. The core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which is defined to make causally separable concepts orthogonal. This causal inner product resolves the geometric unidentifiability problem by unifying the embedding and unembedding representations into a single, coherent geometric space. This unification allows for the construction of \"measurement\" representations (via linear probing) and \"intervention\" representations (via steering vectors) from a single notion of concept direction. Empirical validation using LLaMA-2 demonstrates the existence of these linear representations, the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic structure, and the utility of the unified representations for both interpreting and controlling model behavior.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis\" using counterfactual pairs to define linear representations in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, characterized by making causally separable concepts orthogonal, which resolves geometric unidentifiability.\n*   This causal inner product unifies embedding and unembedding representations, enabling the construction of both measurement (probing) and intervention (steering) representations from a common concept direction.\n*   Empirical results with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear concept representations and demonstrate that the causal inner product respects semantic structure, facilitating interpretation and control.",

It formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" proposing that high-level concepts are represented linearly as directions within these spaces. The authors define two formalizations of linear representation: \"unembedding representations\" in the output space, linked to measurement (probing), and \"embedding representations\" in the input space, linked to intervention (steering). A core contribution is the definition of a \"causal inner product,\" which mandates that causally separable concepts are represented by orthogonal vectors. This causal inner product is shown to unify the embedding and unembedding representations, resolving the geometric unidentifiability problem. The paper demonstrates empirically with LLaMA-2 that this causal inner product respects semantic structure and that these linear representations can be used for both interpretation and control.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes \"linear representation\" in language models using counterfactual pairs, defining distinct unembedding (output space, for measurement) and embedding (input space, for intervention) representations.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, defined by the property that causally separable concepts are orthogonal, which crucially unifies embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   This causal inner product resolves the geometric unidentifiability problem, as the standard training objective does not uniquely determine the inner product, but a causal structure does.\n*   Empirical validation with LLaMA-2 confirms the existence of linear representations and demonstrates that the causal inner product enables both model interpretation (measurement) and control (intervention).",

The authors formalize this hypothesis by defining \"unembedding\" and \"embedding\" representations of concepts using counterfactual pairs. They demonstrate that unembedding representations relate to concept measurement (e.g., prediction), while embedding representations relate to concept intervention (e.g., model steering). A key challenge identified is the geometric unidentifiability of these spaces, meaning standard geometric notions like cosine similarity and projection are ill-defined without a proper inner product. The paper proposes a \"causal inner product\" that encodes the principle of causal separability (concepts that can vary independently should be orthogonal). This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, providing a principled way to define geometric operations that respect the semantic structure of language. Empirical validation using LLaMA-2 demonstrates the existence of these linear representations, the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic structure and enabling model interpretation and control, and its superiority over the Euclidean inner product.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper addresses the geometric unidentifiability of representation spaces in large language models (LLMs) by proposing and formalizing the concept of a causal inner product. The authors demonstrate that while LLMs may represent concepts linearly in distinct \"embedding\" (input context) and \"unembedding\" (output word) spaces, these representations are not directly comparable due to the inherent unidentifiability of the underlying geometric structure. The key insight is that a \"causal inner product\" can unify these seemingly separate representations. This inner product is defined by the property that causally separable concepts (those that can vary independently) are represented as orthogonal vectors. By estimating this causal inner product, the paper shows how to reconcile the embedding and unembedding notions of linear representation, effectively resolving the geometric unidentifiability. This framework allows for a unified understanding of concepts as linear directions and provides a basis for both model interpretation (measurement) and control (intervention), empirically validated on LLaMA-2.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Geometric unidentifiability in LLM representation spaces means that linear concepts can be represented in different, incomparable ways in input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces.\n*   The paper introduces a \"causal inner product\" as a solution, defined by the orthogonality of causally separable concepts in the representation space.\n*   This causal inner product unifies the distinct embedding and unembedding representations of concepts, allowing for a coherent geometric interpretation.\n*   The proposed framework formalizes the \"Linear Representation Hypothesis\" and connects linear representations to both model interpretation (measurement) and control (intervention).\n*   Experiments on LLaMA-2 confirm the existence of linear concept representations and demonstrate that the estimated causal inner product respects semantic structure and enables unified interpretation/control.",
