SUMMARY:\nThis research critiques the conclusions drawn from model-specific studies in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), using the Qwen model family as a case study. The study demonstrates that Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, can achieve significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning tasks even with entirely spurious or weak reward signals (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, format-based rewards). These gains are often comparable to those achieved with ground-truth rewards. Crucially, these spurious rewards that benefit Qwen models frequently fail to improve other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, highlighting a critical lack of generalizability. The paper hypothesizes that RLVR, especially with spurious signals, primarily elicits pre-existing reasoning capabilities within the model. For Qwen2.5-Math, this often manifests as \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for problem-solving without actual execution), which strongly correlates with improved accuracy. The research emphasizes that RLVR findings should be validated across diverse model architectures to avoid drawing conclusions based on model-specific artifacts.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, show substantial performance improvements in RLVR with spurious reward signals (e.g., random, incorrect labels) that are comparable to ground-truth rewards.\n*   These spurious reward signals are not effective on other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, indicating that performance gains are highly model-dependent.\n*   The success of spurious rewards on Qwen models is attributed to their ability to elicit pre-existing reasoning strategies, such as \"code reasoning,\" which correlates with higher accuracy.\n*   The study strongly suggests that RLVR research conclusions should be validated on diverse model families, not just a single chosen model like Qwen, to avoid spurious correlations.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research critiques the conclusions drawn from model-specific studies in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), using the Qwen model family as a case study. The paper demonstrates that RLVR can achieve significant performance gains on Qwen models even with entirely spurious or weak reward signals (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, format-only rewards). These gains can be comparable to those achieved with ground truth rewards. Crucially, these spurious rewards often fail to yield similar improvements on other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, highlighting that the effectiveness of RLVR is highly dependent on the model's pre-training. The study identifies \"code reasoning\" – generating Python code for mathematical problem-solving without actual execution – as a distinctive and prevalent behavior in Qwen2.5-Math models that is amplified by RLVR, even with spurious rewards. This suggests that RLVR might be surfacing and upweighting existing, latent reasoning capabilities rather than teaching entirely new ones. The findings underscore the need for broader model validation in RLVR research to avoid drawing conclusions based on model-specific idiosyncrasies.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve substantial performance gains on Qwen models using weak or spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format), often matching ground truth rewards.\n*   These spurious reward effects do not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, indicating that model-specific pre-training plays a critical role.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit strong \"code reasoning\" (using Python for math without execution), a behavior that RLVR significantly amplifies, even with spurious rewards, correlating with performance improvements.\n*   The research cautions against drawing general conclusions from RLVR studies focused solely on Qwen models, advocating for broader model validation.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is hypothesized to stem from RLVR's ability to elicit and upweight pre-existing, useful reasoning patterns within specific models, rather than imparting new knowledge.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research critically examines the effectiveness of spurious rewards in Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) using the Qwen model family as a case study. The findings reveal that Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, can achieve significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning tasks even with reward signals that are incorrect, random, or simply follow a format, often approaching gains seen with ground-truth rewards. This suggests that RLVR, in many cases, elicits latent reasoning capabilities already present in the base model rather than teaching new skills. Crucially, these spurious rewards do not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, highlighting a strong dependence on the model's pretraining data and inherent behaviors. The study identifies \"code reasoning\" – using Python-like structures without actual execution – as a prominent behavior in Qwen models that is amplified by RLVR, even with spurious signals, leading to improved accuracy. This work cautions against drawing conclusions solely from Qwen models in RLVR research, advocating for broader model validation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen models, especially Qwen2.5-Math, show substantial performance improvements in RLVR with spurious rewards (incorrect, random, format-based), often matching ground truth gains.\n*   These spurious reward effects are not generalizable and fail to improve other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, indicating model-specific pretraining influences.\n*   Qwen models exhibit a strong \"code reasoning\" behavior that is amplified by RLVR, even with spurious rewards, and this behavior correlates with higher accuracy.\n*   The study suggests RLVR primarily surfaces existing model capabilities rather than teaching new ones, and that current RLVR research conclusions drawn from Qwen models may not be universally applicable.\n*   There's a call for future RLVR research to be validated on diverse model architectures to avoid misleading conclusions based on model-specific sensitivities to spurious signals.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research critically examines the impact of spurious rewards in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), using the Qwen model family as a primary case study. The study reveals that Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, can achieve significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning tasks even with nonsensical or incorrect reward signals (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, or format-based rewards). These gains are often comparable to those achieved with ground truth rewards. Crucially, this phenomenon is not observed in other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, which show minimal or even degraded performance with spurious rewards. The paper hypothesizes that Qwen models' strong pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capabilities—generating Python code to aid mathematical problem-solving—are being effectively elicited by RLVR, irrespective of the reward signal's validity. This highlights a critical issue in RLVR research: conclusions drawn from Qwen models may not generalize, as performance gains can be artifacts of spurious signals and model-specific pre-training biases. The findings strongly advocate for cross-model validation in future RLVR research.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen models, especially Qwen2.5-Math, exhibit substantial performance improvements in RLVR even with spurious rewards (random, incorrect labels, format-based), often matching ground truth rewards.\n*   These spurious reward gains are largely absent in other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, indicating model-specific pre-training influences.\n*   Qwen models' strong \"code reasoning\" behavior (generating Python for math) is identified as a key pre-existing capability that RLVR effectively elicits, driving performance gains irrespective of reward quality.\n*   The research cautions against drawing general conclusions from Qwen-centric RLVR studies, as performance gains may be due to spurious signals and not generalizable improvements.\n*   Future RLVR research should prioritize validation across diverse model families to avoid misleading conclusions based on model-specific artifacts.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research critically examines the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its susceptibility to spurious reward signals, particularly when applied to the Qwen model family. The study demonstrates that Qwen models, especially Qwen2.5-Math, can achieve significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning tasks (e.g., MATH-500) even with rewards that are random, incorrect, or simply based on output formatting. These gains often rival those achieved with ground-truth rewards. Crucially, these spurious rewards fail to generalize to other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, highlighting a strong model-specific bias. The paper identifies \"code reasoning\"—the generation of Python code to aid mathematical thought, even without execution—as a key pre-existing capability in Qwen models that RLVR, even with spurious signals, effectively amplifies. This amplification of pre-trained behaviors, rather than learning new reasoning skills, is presented as the primary mechanism behind the observed performance boosts. The work serves as a cautionary tale for RLVR research, urging validation across diverse models and warning against drawing conclusions solely from Qwen-centric experiments due to the ease with which superficial improvements can be achieved.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, show substantial performance gains in RLVR with spurious rewards (random, incorrect format), often matching ground-truth reward performance.\n*   These spurious reward effects do not generalize to other model families (Llama3, OLMo2), indicating a model-specific susceptibility and a critique of Qwen-centric research.\n*   \"Code reasoning,\" a pre-existing capability in Qwen models where they generate Python code for mathematical thought, is identified as the primary mechanism driving performance gains from spurious RLVR.\n*   The research cautions that RLVR may amplify existing, rather than teach new, reasoning abilities, and urges broader model validation beyond Qwen.\n*   Interventions that explicitly encourage code reasoning (e.g., prompting) also significantly boost Qwen performance, further supporting the hypothesis that RLVR capitalizes on pre-trained reasoning patterns.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research critically examines the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) by demonstrating how easily performance gains can be achieved with spurious reward signals, particularly in the Qwen model family. The study reveals that Qwen models, especially Qwen2.5-Math, exhibit substantial improvements on mathematical reasoning tasks even when trained with rewards that are random, incorrect, or merely based on output formatting. These gains often approach those achieved with ground truth rewards. Crucially, these spurious rewards fail to generalize to other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, indicating that their effectiveness is tied to specific pre-trained behaviors. The paper identifies \"code reasoning\"—Qwen models' tendency to generate Python code for mathematical problem-solving—as a key pre-existing capability that RLVR amplifies. This finding serves as a cautionary tale, suggesting that RLVR research conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models may be misleading and that future work should be validated on diverse model architectures to avoid spurious correlations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, show significant performance gains in RLVR even with spurious rewards (random, incorrect labels, format-based), often matching ground truth reward performance.\n*   These spurious rewards do not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, highlighting model-specific pre-training influences.\n*   Qwen models' \"code reasoning\" (generating Python for math) is a key pre-trained behavior amplified by RLVR, driving performance gains.\n*   The study cautions against drawing conclusions solely from Qwen models in RLVR research, as spurious signals can easily inflate performance metrics.\n*   RLVR primarily elicits and upweights existing pre-trained reasoning strategies rather than teaching entirely new ones.",

The paper demonstrates that Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, exhibit significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning tasks even when trained with spurious or weak reward signals (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, format rewards). These gains can approach those achieved with ground truth rewards, highlighting a concerning ease of achieving performance improvements through potentially superficial means. Crucially, these spurious rewards do not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, indicating that Qwen's specific pre-training or architecture is key to this phenomenon. The study identifies \"code reasoning\"—generating Python code for mathematical problem-solving without actual execution—as a distinctive pre-trained behavior in Qwen models that is heavily amplified by RLVR, even with spurious signals. This suggests that RLVR might be primarily eliciting latent capabilities rather than teaching new reasoning skills, especially in Qwen models. The work serves as a strong critique of RLVR research that relies predominantly on Qwen models, warning that such conclusions may not be generalizable and urging validation across diverse model architectures.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, achieve substantial performance improvements in mathematical reasoning through RLVR even with completely spurious or weak reward signals (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format).\n*   These gains from spurious rewards are not generalizable to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, suggesting Qwen's unique pre-training or architecture is responsible for this sensitivity.\n*   \"Code reasoning\" (generating Python code for math without execution) is a prominent, pre-trained behavior in Qwen models that RLVR significantly amplifies, even with uninformative rewards, correlating strongly with performance gains.\n*   The research critiques RLVR studies that exclusively use Qwen models, warning that observed performance gains might be artifacts of spurious signals rather than genuine reasoning improvements, and recommends validation across diverse models.\n*   The optimization algorithm's properties (like GRPO's clipping bias) can create a perceived training signal from random rewards by amplifying existing model behaviors, explaining the Qwen model's susceptibility.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research critiques the reliance on model-specific conclusions in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), using the Qwen model family as a case study. The study demonstrates that RLVR can achieve significant performance gains on Qwen models even with entirely spurious reward signals (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, or format-based rewards), often matching gains from ground truth rewards. This effect is largely attributed to RLVR amplifying pre-existing reasoning strategies within the model, particularly \"code reasoning\" (using Python for mathematical thought without execution), which Qwen models exhibit prominently. Crucially, these spurious rewards and the observed code reasoning amplification do not generalize to other model families like Llama or OLMo, highlighting a critical limitation of Qwen-centric RLVR research. The paper suggests that the effectiveness of RLVR, especially with spurious signals, is heavily dependent on the model's pretraining data and inherent reasoning capabilities, and warns against drawing broad conclusions solely from Qwen-based experiments. The study also delves into the GRPO clipping bias as a mechanism that can inadvertently create training signals from random rewards by favoring existing model behaviors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can produce substantial performance gains on Qwen models using spurious rewards (random, incorrect labels, format), often comparable to ground truth rewards.\n*   These gains are largely due to RLVR amplifying pre-existing reasoning strategies in Qwen models, such as \"code reasoning,\" which are not shared by other model families like Llama or OLMo.\n*   Conclusions drawn from Qwen-centric RLVR research may not generalize, as spurious rewards and observed mechanisms (like code reasoning amplification) fail to yield similar benefits in other model families.\n*   The GRPO algorithm's clipping bias can create apparent training signals from random rewards by exploiting and amplifying existing model priors, rather than from the informativeness of the reward signal itself.\n*   Prompting significantly impacts Qwen model performance, with even task-irrelevant \"spurious prompts\" leading to high initial accuracy, underscoring model sensitivity and the need for diverse evaluation.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research critically examines the conclusions drawn from Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) in current literature, particularly highlighting how easily performance gains can be achieved with spurious reward signals, using the Qwen model family as a case study. The study demonstrates that various weak or even incorrect reward signals (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, format rewards) can lead to substantial performance improvements on Qwen2.5-Math models, often rivaling the gains from ground truth rewards. Crucially, these spurious rewards do not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, which show minimal or negative gains. This divergence is attributed to Qwen models' pre-existing \"code reasoning\" behavior, where they generate Python code to aid mathematical problem-solving. RLVR appears to amplify this pre-existing strategy, leading to performance boosts. The paper warns that conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models may be misleading due to this susceptibility to spurious signals, advocating for broader model validation in future RLVR research.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Spurious reward signals (random, incorrect labels, format) yield significant performance gains on Qwen2.5-Math models, comparable to ground truth rewards.\n*   These spurious reward effects are highly model-specific and do not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2.\n*   Qwen models' \"code reasoning\" ability, where they generate Python code for math problems, is a key factor enabling spurious rewards to elicit performance improvements.\n*   The GRPO algorithm's clipping bias may contribute to amplifying pre-existing model behaviors, explaining the effectiveness of random rewards on Qwen models.\n*   The study warns that RLVR research conclusions based solely on Qwen models may be unreliable due to their susceptibility to spurious signals and calls for validation across diverse models.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research critically examines the conclusions drawn from Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) in current literature, particularly highlighting how easily performance gains can be achieved with spurious reward signals, using the Qwen model family as a case study. The study demonstrates that various weak or even incorrect reward signals (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, format rewards) can lead to substantial performance improvements on Qwen2.5-Math models, often rivaling the gains from ground truth rewards. Crucially, these spurious rewards do not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, which show minimal or negative gains. This divergence is attributed to Qwen models' pre-existing \"code reasoning\" behavior, where they generate Python code to aid mathematical problem-solving. RLVR appears to amplify this pre-existing strategy, leading to performance boosts. The paper warns that conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models may be misleading due to this susceptibility to spurious signals, advocating for broader model validation in future RLVR research.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Spurious reward signals (random, incorrect labels, format) yield significant performance gains on Qwen2.5-Math models, comparable to ground truth rewards.\n*   These spurious reward effects are highly model-specific and do not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2.\n*   Qwen models' \"code reasoning\" ability, where they generate Python code for math problems, is a key factor enabling spurious rewards to elicit performance improvements.\n*   The GRPO algorithm's clipping bias may contribute to amplifying pre-existing model behaviors, explaining the effectiveness of random rewards on Qwen models.\n*   The study warns that RLVR research conclusions based solely on Qwen models may be unreliable due to their susceptibility to spurious signals and calls for validation across diverse models.",
