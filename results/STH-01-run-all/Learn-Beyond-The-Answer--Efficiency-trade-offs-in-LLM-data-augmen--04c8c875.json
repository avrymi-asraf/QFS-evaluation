Unlike traditional methods that expand the training dataset with more examples, RefAug enriches each training instance by appending a \"reflective section.\" This section encourages the LLM to consider alternative approaches to solving a problem and explore follow-up reasoning, such as abstraction or analogy to more complex scenarios. The authors demonstrate that RefAug significantly improves performance on standard single-round math reasoning tasks, yielding a +7.2 accuracy gain. Crucially, it also substantially enhances performance on more complex reflective reasoning tasks (like follow-up questions and error correction) where traditional augmentation methods fall short. RefAug is shown to be complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to further gains when combined. The method maintains inference efficiency by ceasing generation before the reflective section. Experiments also show RefAug's effectiveness in code generation tasks, indicating its broader applicability.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) embeds problem reflection (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data, enhancing LLMs' mathematical reasoning beyond simple answer generation.\n*   RefAug improves performance on standard math reasoning by +7.2 accuracy and significantly boosts capabilities in complex reflective reasoning scenarios where other methods fail.\n*   The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, leading to synergistic performance gains.\n*   Despite adding reflective content, RefAug maintains inference efficiency due to early stopping during generation.\n*   The method is also effective for code generation tasks, suggesting its general applicability in improving LLM reasoning.",
