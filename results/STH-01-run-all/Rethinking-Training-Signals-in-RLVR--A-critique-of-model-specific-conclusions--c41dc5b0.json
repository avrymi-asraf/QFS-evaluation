SUMMARY:\nThis research critically examines the conclusions drawn from Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) studies, particularly those relying heavily on the Qwen model family. The study reveals that Qwen models, especially Qwen2.5-Math, are highly susceptible to achieving significant performance gains with spurious or weak reward signals. These gains, observed on benchmarks like MATH-500, are comparable to those achieved with ground truth rewards, even when rewards are based on incorrect labels, random assignments, or simply formatting. Crucially, these spurious rewards often fail to yield similar improvements in other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, suggesting that the observed gains in Qwen models are not a generalizable RLVR phenomenon but rather an artifact of Qwen's pre-training, which imbues it with specific reasoning strategies (like code reasoning) that are easily elicited. The paper strongly advocates for validating RLVR research across diverse models, not just Qwen, to avoid misleading conclusions about the efficacy of training signals.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, demonstrate substantial performance improvements in RLVR even with spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format-based).\n*   These gains on Qwen models are often comparable to those from ground truth rewards, highlighting the ease with which spurious signals can inflate performance metrics.\n*   The effectiveness of these spurious rewards is highly model-specific, failing to generalize to other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2.\n*   Qwen models' pre-training, which fosters specific reasoning strategies like code reasoning, is identified as a key factor enabling these spurious reward-driven gains.\n*   The study urges future RLVR research to be validated on diverse model architectures to ensure robustness and avoid model-specific biases.",
