      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces \"reflective augmentation\" (RefAug), a novel data augmentation technique for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning. Unlike traditional instance-dimension augmentation methods that expand the training set by adding more problems, RefAug targets the sequence dimension by appending a \"reflective section\" to existing training instances. This reflective section includes alternative reasoning paths or follow-up reasoning (abstraction/analogy), encouraging the LLM to deeply understand problems and engage in reflective thinking. Experiments show that RefAug significantly boosts performance in standard single-round question-answering settings (+7.2 accuracy) and, more importantly, excels in complex reflective reasoning scenarios (like error correction and multi-turn problem-solving) where traditional methods falter. Furthermore, RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to even greater performance improvements when combined. The method also demonstrates effectiveness in code generation tasks, underscoring the general applicability of reflection for improving LLM reasoning capabilities.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) enhances LLM reasoning by adding \"reflection\" (alternative/follow-up reasoning) to existing training instances, operating on the sequence dimension rather than instance dimension.\n*   RefAug improves performance on standard math reasoning tasks and significantly boosts capabilities in complex reflective reasoning scenarios where traditional data augmentation methods are less effective.\n*   The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to synergistic performance gains when combined.\n*   RefAug is effective in improving LLM performance on code generation tasks, demonstrating its general applicability beyond mathematics.\n*   During inference, RefAug does not impact efficiency as the model stops generation before the reflective section.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel data augmentation technique for Large Language Models (LLMs) focused on enhancing mathematical reasoning. Unlike traditional instance-dimension augmentation that expands the dataset by adding more problems, RefAug operates on the sequence-dimension by appending a \"reflective section\" to existing training instances. This section includes alternative approaches or follow-up reasoning (abstraction/analogy) to a problem's solution. The core idea is to train LLMs to deeply understand problems rather than just memorize solutions, thereby improving performance in both standard single-round question-answering and more complex reflective reasoning scenarios (like error correction or follow-up questions). Experiments show RefAug significantly boosts performance across various math reasoning tasks and is complementary to existing augmentation methods, yielding even greater gains when combined. Crucially, during inference, RefAug does not impact efficiency as it uses a termination signal to stop generation before the reflective section.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug augments training data by adding a \"reflective section\" (alternative/follow-up reasoning) to existing problem solutions, focusing on deeper understanding rather than just more examples.\n*   RefAug significantly enhances LLM performance in complex reflective reasoning tasks (e.g., error correction, follow-up questions), where traditional instance-dimension augmentation methods fall short.\n*   RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, leading to substantial performance improvements when combined.\n*   During inference, RefAug does not affect efficiency due to an early stopping mechanism that prevents the model from generating the reflective content.",
