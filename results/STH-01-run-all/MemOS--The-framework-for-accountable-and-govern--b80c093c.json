      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nMemOS is proposed as a memory operating system for Large Language Models (LLMs) to address their fundamental lack of structured memory management, aiming to equip them with accountable and governed memory capabilities. This framework elevates memory to a first-class operational resource, establishing unified mechanisms for representation, organization, and governance across parametric, activation, and plaintext memory types. At its core is the MemCube, a standardized memory abstraction that facilitates tracking, fusion, and migration of heterogeneous memory, while providing structured, traceable access across tasks and contexts. MemOS establishes a memory-centric execution framework designed for strong controllability, adaptability, and evolvability. By treating memory as a schedulable and governable resource, MemOS enables LLMs to continuously adapt, maintain behavioral consistency across platforms, and evolve over time. This foundational infrastructure is crucial for next-generation intelligent systems that require long-term knowledge evolution, personalized intelligence, and cross-platform coordination, moving beyond static generation to agents that remember, adapt, and grow.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   MemOS is a memory operating system designed to provide accountable and governed memory for LLMs, treating memory as a first-class resource.\n*   It unifies three core memory types—parametric, activation, and plaintext—under a standardized abstraction called MemCube.\n*   MemCube enables tracking, fusion, and migration of heterogeneous memory with structured, traceable access across tasks and contexts.\n*   The framework aims to enhance LLM controllability, adaptability, and evolvability for long-term knowledge evolution and personalized intelligence.\n*   MemOS establishes a memory-centric execution paradigm crucial for next-generation intelligent systems and multi-agent coordination.",
