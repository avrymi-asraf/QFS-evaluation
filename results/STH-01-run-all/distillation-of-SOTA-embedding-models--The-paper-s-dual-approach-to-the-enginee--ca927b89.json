The authors propose a novel multi-stage distillation framework to train a smaller student model, Jasper, to inherit the capabilities of multiple larger state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models. This distillation process employs three distinct loss functions: cosine loss for aligning absolute representations, similarity loss for semantic consistency between text pairs, and relative similarity distillation loss for capturing ranking preferences. To further tackle the issue of high vector dimensionality often associated with SOTA models, the framework incorporates Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). This approach allows the student model to effectively compress its vector representations into lower dimensions while maintaining performance. The resulting Jasper model, with 2 billion parameters, achieves performance comparable to 7 billion parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating the efficacy of this dual approach to embedding dimensionality reduction and knowledge transfer.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper introduces a multi-stage distillation framework to transfer knowledge from multiple large teacher embedding models to a smaller student model (Jasper).\n*   A key component of the approach is the use of three carefully designed loss functions (cosine, similarity, and relative similarity distillation) to guide the student model's learning.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student embedding model.\n*   The Jasper model, despite having 2 billion parameters, achieves performance comparable to 7 billion parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MTEB leaderboard, comparable to 7B parameter models. The core of Jasper's development lies in a novel multi-stage distillation framework designed to tackle the engineering challenge of embedding dimensionality. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from multiple large teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella) using a combination of cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. These stages progressively train parameters, starting with a fully connected layer and then incorporating the last three encoder layers. Stage 3 addresses the high dimensionality resulting from teacher concatenation by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). This stage utilizes additional fully connected layers to generate lower-dimensional vectors, relying on similarity and relative similarity losses, while the initial high-dimensional output is still trained with all three losses. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by aligning image and text embeddings using self-distillation with a vision encoder, though this stage is noted as preliminary. Jasper's architecture comprises a language model encoder, a vision encoder, a pooler, and fully connected layers for projection.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art performance for its size, comparable to 7 billion parameter models, by employing a novel multi-stage distillation framework. The framework effectively distills knowledge from multiple large teacher embedding models, specifically NV-Embed-v2 (4096 dimensions) and Stella_en_1.5B_v5 (8192 dimensions), using three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (Lcosine), similarity loss (Lsim), and relative similarity distillation loss (Lresim). Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from these teachers, with Stage 1 training only a fully connected layer (FC1) and Stage 2 training FC1 and the last three encoder layers. Stage 3 addresses the challenge of high vector dimensionality (12288 dimensions post-concatenation) by utilizing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers (FC2, FC3, FC4) to generate lower-dimensional vectors. In this stage, Lcosine is omitted for the reduced dimension FC layers due to misaligned dimensions, while Lsim and Lresim are used. Stage 4 aims to unlock multimodal potential by aligning image and text embeddings using self-distillation on image-caption pairs, though its current implementation has limitations. Jasper's performance on the MTEB leaderboard, achieving an average score of 71.54 across 56 datasets, validates this dual approach to embedding dimensionality.\n\n2.

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art performance for its size, comparable to 7 billion parameter models, by employing a novel multi-stage distillation framework. The framework effectively distills knowledge from multiple large teacher embedding models, specifically NV-Embed-v2 (4096 dimensions) and Stella_en_1.5B_v5 (8192 dimensions), using three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (Lcosine), similarity loss (Lsim), and relative similarity distillation loss (Lresim). Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from these teachers, with Stage 1 training only a fully connected layer (FC1) and Stage 2 training FC1 and the last three encoder layers. Stage 3 addresses the challenge of high vector dimensionality (12288 dimensions post-concatenation) by utilizing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers (FC2, FC3, FC4) to generate lower-dimensional vectors. In this stage, Lcosine is omitted for the reduced dimension FC layers due to misaligned dimensions, while Lsim and Lresim are used. Stage 4 aims to unlock multimodal potential by aligning image and text embeddings using self-distillation on image-caption pairs, though its current implementation has limitations. Jasper's performance on the MTEB leaderboard, achieving an average score of 71.54 across 56 datasets, validates this dual approach to embedding dimensionality.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a multi-stage distillation process using NV-Embed-v2 (4096D) and Stella_en_1.5B_v5 (8192D) as teacher models.\n*   Distillation leverages cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss, with specific parameter training in Stages 1 and 2.\n*   Stage 3 utilizes Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) and fully connected layers for dimension reduction, omitting cosine loss for the reduced dimension outputs due to dimension misalignment.\n*   Jasper achieves comparable performance to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of its distillation and dimension reduction strategies.\n*   Stage 4 introduces multimodal capabilities through self-distillation but acknowledges limitations in the current implementation.",
