SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates strategies for curating compact, high-quality datasets to enhance reinforcement learning (RL) training efficiency for small LLMs under resource constraints. The researchers adapted the GRPO algorithm and developed a focused mathematical reasoning dataset, training a 1.5B parameter model on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours. They found that mixing easier and harder problems, coupled with a cosine reward to control output length, significantly improved early reasoning performance (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) and stabilized training. This approach achieved competitive results with minimal data (7,000 samples) and a low training cost ($42), demonstrating a cost-effective alternative to resource-intensive methods. However, challenges like optimization instability and length constraints for complex problems were noted. The work offers practical insights into balancing problem difficulty and reward mechanisms for efficient RL fine-tuning of small LLMs in resource-limited settings.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A compact dataset of 7,000 mixed-difficulty mathematical reasoning problems was curated to balance problem difficulty for efficient RL training of small LLMs.\n*   The study demonstrated that incorporating easier problems alongside challenging ones, and using a cosine reward to manage output length, significantly boosted early reasoning performance and stabilized training for a 1.5B parameter model.\n*   This RL-based approach achieved competitive reasoning accuracy (e.g., 80% on AMC23) with minimal data and a low cost ($42), showcasing a strategy for resource-constrained environments.\n*   The research identified that while initial gains are rapid, prolonged training under strict length constraints can lead to performance degradation, highlighting the need to balance problem difficulty and length management.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the efficacy of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under strict computational constraints. The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset. Experiment 1 showed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 70%) within 50-100 steps with high-quality data, but prolonged training led to performance degradation and instability due to length constraints. Experiment 2, which balanced easy and hard problems, improved initial performance (AMC23 to 80%) and stabilized behavior, though long-term stability remained an issue. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to control output length, improving consistency but slightly reducing peak performance. Crucially, the developed \"Open-RS\" models achieved competitive reasoning scores (e.g., AIME24 at 46.7%) using only 7,000 samples and costing approximately $42, significantly outperforming larger models in both data and cost efficiency. The final curated dataset comprised 39,659 mathematical reasoning questions.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RL can significantly boost reasoning in small LLMs (1.5B parameters) under resource constraints, achieving substantial gains with minimal data (7,000 samples) and cost ($42).\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems in the training dataset (Experiment 2) improved initial performance and stabilized reasoning compared to using only high-quality, difficult data (Experiment 1).\n*   Cosine rewards effectively controlled output length, enhancing training consistency, though longer completion lengths are needed for extremely complex tasks.\n*   The \"Open-RS\" models achieved strong performance, notably surpassing a leading large model (o1-preview) on the AIME24 benchmark, demonstrating a cost-effective alternative to resource-intensive approaches.\n*   The refined s1 dataset was named \"open-s1\", and the combined final dataset consisted of 39,659 mathematical reasoning questions.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the efficacy of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small LLMs (1.5 billion parameters) under strict computational constraints (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24 hours). The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset. Experiment 1 showed rapid initial gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 70%) within 50-100 steps using the open-s1 dataset, but performance degraded with prolonged training due to length constraints. Experiment 2, by mixing easy and hard problems from open-s1 and open-deepscaler (total 7,000 samples) and reducing completion length, achieved better initial performance (AMC23 to 80%) and more stable reasoning, though long-term stability remained an issue. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to control output length, stabilizing it significantly but slightly reducing peak performance. Ultimately, the Open-RS models demonstrated competitive reasoning scores (e.g., AIME24 at 46.7%, surpassing o1-preview) with minimal data and a training cost of $42, offering a cost-effective alternative to resource-intensive methods.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems in a 7,000-sample dataset (open-s1 and open-deepscaler) significantly improved initial reasoning performance (e.g., AMC23 to 80%) and stabilized training for small LLMs under resource constraints.\n*   The cosine reward function effectively stabilized completion lengths, contributing to more consistent training, though extreme length constraints still posed challenges for complex tasks.\n*   RL-based fine-tuning enabled a 1.5B parameter model to achieve competitive reasoning scores (e.g., AIME24 at 46.7%) with minimal data and a low training cost ($42), demonstrating significant efficiency gains.\n*   Performance degradation was observed with prolonged training, particularly when length constraints were strict, indicating a need for careful tuning and potentially curriculum-based data strategies.\n*   The refined open-s1 dataset was created by filtering for '\\boxed{}' answers and removing trivial/noisy questions, resulting in 18,615 examples. The open-deepscaler dataset, focusing solely on math, was reduced to 21,044 examples by excluding easy questions.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints. The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset for a 1.5-billion-parameter model. Experiment 1 showed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains within 50-100 steps using high-quality data, but prolonged training leads to performance degradation and issues with length constraints. Experiment 2 demonstrated that mixing easy and hard problems, coupled with reduced length constraints, improved early performance and stabilized reasoning. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to better control output length, leading to more consistent completion lengths, though it slightly reduced peak performance. Overall, the proposed \"Open-RS\" approach achieved competitive reasoning performance on benchmarks like AMC23 and AIME24, surpassing some larger models, at a significantly lower cost ($42) and with much less data (7,000 samples) compared to baseline models. The essentiality of filtering and refining datasets for RL training was highlighted, with the final combined dataset size being 39,659 samples.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 from 63% to 80%) using RL with a compact dataset (7,000 samples) and minimal cost ($42).\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems in the training dataset enhances early reasoning performance and stabilizes training for small LLMs.\n*   Cosine rewards effectively control output length, improving training consistency, though longer completion limits are needed for extremely complex tasks.\n*   Prolonged training beyond 100-200 steps with strict length constraints can lead to performance degradation and unstable behavior in small LLMs.\n*   The study emphasizes the critical role of rigorous data filtering and refinement for creating effective datasets for RL-based reasoning enhancement in LLMs.",

Their approach involved three experiments using the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model, training on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours. Key findings demonstrate that small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning gains rapidly (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) with minimal data (7,000 samples) and low cost ($42), outperforming larger models and previous benchmarks like o1-preview. Experiment 2, which balanced easy and hard problems in the dataset, showed improved initial performance and stabilized reasoning behavior compared to using only complex problems. However, challenges such as optimization instability and length constraints emerged with prolonged training, necessitating strategies like cosine rewards for length control.

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small large language models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints. The research team adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset to train a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. The dataset curation involved filtering existing corpora like s1 and DeepScaleR to isolate challenging mathematical problems. Experiment 1 showed that small LLMs can achieve rapid initial reasoning gains with high-quality data but degrade with prolonged training due to length constraints. Experiment 2 demonstrated that mixing easy and hard problems in a 7,000-sample dataset improved early performance and stabilized reasoning by reducing completion lengths. Experiment 3 further refined length control using a cosine reward. The resulting Open-RS models achieved competitive reasoning scores, outperforming some 7B models and matching top 1.5B models, at a significantly lower cost ($42) and with less data than baselines. This highlights RL's potential for efficient reasoning enhancement in resource-limited environments, despite challenges like optimization instability and multilingual drift.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements with RL using a compact dataset (7,000 samples) and limited resources (4x A40 GPUs, 24 hours, $42 cost).\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems in the dataset (Experiment 2) improved initial performance and stabilized reasoning behavior compared to using only hard problems (Experiment 1).\n*   Performance degradation was observed with prolonged training under strict length constraints, suggesting a need for careful dataset balancing and length management.\n*   The curated datasets, \"open-s1\" (18,615 samples) and \"open-deepscaler\" (21,044 samples), were refined through specific filtering steps to isolate high-quality mathematical reasoning problems.\n*   The Open-RS models achieved competitive reasoning scores, with Open-RS3 reaching 46.7% on AIME24, surpassing o1-preview.",

The study focuses on a 1.5B parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, trained on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours. A key strategy involved curating a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset by filtering and refining existing corpora like s1 and DeepScaleR. The refined s1 dataset, named open-s1, and the refined DeepScaleR dataset, named open-deepscaler, were combined into a final dataset of 39,659 samples. Experiments revealed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains with limited, high-quality data, but prolonged training leads to performance degradation, particularly under strict length constraints. Experiment 2, which balanced easy and hard problems in a 7,000-sample dataset, showed improved initial performance and stabilized reasoning, though long-term stability remained a challenge. The use of a cosine reward in Experiment 3 effectively controlled output length, improving consistency, but indicated a need for longer completion lengths for extremely difficult tasks. The findings demonstrate RL's viability for small LLMs, achieving competitive performance with significantly less data and cost ($42 for Open-RS vs. thousands for baselines), offering a scalable solution for resource-constrained environments.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small large language models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints. Researchers successfully adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset. By balancing problem difficulty within a 7,000-sample dataset, they observed significant initial reasoning gains, with AMC23 accuracy improving from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7% within 50-100 training steps. This approach achieved these results with a minimal training cost of $42 on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours, significantly outperforming larger models and previous small LLM efforts in terms of cost and data efficiency. However, prolonged training led to performance degradation and optimization instability, particularly due to length constraints and the multilingual nature of the base model, highlighting the trade-offs involved. The findings demonstrate the viability of RL for resource-constrained reasoning enhancement in small LLMs, offering a scalable alternative to resource-intensive methods.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RL can significantly improve the reasoning performance of small LLMs (1.5B parameters) under severe resource constraints (4x A40 GPUs, 24 hours), achieving competitive results at a fraction of the cost ($42).\n*   Curating a compact dataset (7,000 samples) that balances problem difficulty is crucial for efficient RL training, leading to rapid reasoning gains within the initial 50-100 steps.\n*   Performance degradation and instability were observed with prolonged training, primarily due to strict length constraints and the multilingual nature of the base model.\n*   The study's Open-RS models demonstrated strong performance on mathematical benchmarks, with Open-RS3 achieving the highest AIME24 score (46.7%), surpassing o1-preview.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small LLMs (1.5B parameters) under strict resource constraints (4 A40 GPUs, 24 hours). The core strategy involved curating a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset and adapting the GRPO algorithm. Experiment 1, using a refined dataset of 18,615 samples (open-s1), showed rapid initial gains but degraded due to length constraints. Experiment 2, by balancing dataset difficulty with 7,000 samples (mix of refined open-s1 and open-deepscaler), improved early performance and stabilized behavior, though persistent length and multilingual challenges remained. Experiment 3 further refined length control using a cosine reward. The resulting Open-RS models achieved competitive performance, with Open-RS3 reaching 46.7% on AIME24, surpassing o1-preview, at a significantly lower cost ($42) and data volume (7,000 samples) compared to baselines. This demonstrates RL's viability for efficient reasoning in resource-constrained settings, though careful dataset curation and reward design are crucial.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements with RL using compact, high-quality datasets (e.g., 7,000 samples) under strict resource constraints.\n*   Balancing dataset difficulty by mixing easier and harder problems (as in Experiment 2) enhances early performance and stabilizes reasoning behavior compared to using only complex data.\n*   The cosine reward effectively controls output length, improving training consistency, but extending length limits is necessary for very hard tasks, especially with multilingual base models.\n*   The Open-RS approach achieved competitive reasoning performance at a drastically reduced cost ($42) and data usage (7,000 samples) compared to larger models and other fine-tuning methods.\n*   Key challenges identified include optimization instability and language drift due to length constraints and the multilingual nature of the base model.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research explores using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints. The study focuses on a 1.5B parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, trained on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours. A key strategy involved curating compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning datasets. The \"open-s1\" dataset was refined from a general reasoning corpus by filtering for LaTeX's `\\boxed{}` command and using LLMs to remove trivial or noisy examples, resulting in 18,615 mathematical examples. The \"open-deepscaler\" dataset, already math-focused, was further refined to 21,044 examples. Combining these created a 39,659 sample dataset.\n\nExperiment 2 demonstrated that mixing easy and hard problems (7,000 samples total) significantly improved early reasoning performance (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) and stabilized behavior compared to using only hard problems. This approach balanced problem difficulty to enhance RL training efficiency. However, prolonged training still led to performance degradation and issues with length constraints and multilingualism. Despite these challenges, the proposed method achieved competitive reasoning scores with minimal data and cost ($42), offering a cost-effective alternative for resource-constrained environments.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Curating compact, high-quality datasets is crucial for efficient RL training of small LLMs under resource constraints.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems (e.g., 7,000 samples) in the dataset significantly boosted early reasoning performance and stabilized training for small LLMs.\n*   The \"open-s1\" dataset was refined from a general corpus to 18,615 mathematical examples by filtering for `\\boxed{}` and using LLMs to remove low-quality data.\n*   RL fine-tuning on a small, curated dataset achieved significant reasoning gains on benchmarks like AMC23 (63% to 80%) with minimal cost ($42).\n*   Challenges remain with prolonged training, including performance degradation, length constraints, and multilingualism, even with mixed-difficulty datasets.",
