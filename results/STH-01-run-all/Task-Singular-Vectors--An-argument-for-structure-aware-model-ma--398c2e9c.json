The authors argue that existing methods, like Task Arithmetic, overlook crucial structural information by treating entire models as flat vectors, leading to task interference. Their proposed method, Task Singular Vectors (TSV), analyzes model weight differences at the layer level using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). They demonstrate that per-layer task matrices are low-rank, allowing for significant compression (TSV-Compress or TSV-C) while retaining high accuracy. Furthermore, by examining the interaction of singular vectors across tasks, they introduce a measure of task interference (STI) and a new merging technique (TSV-Merge or TSV-M). TSV-M combines compression with interference reduction by decorrelating singular vectors, significantly outperforming prior methods and establishing a new state-of-the-art in model merging by reducing task interference.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper advocates for structure-aware model manipulation over flattened parameter approaches, identifying task interference as a key limitation of existing methods.\n*   Task Singular Vectors (TSV), derived from the SVD of per-layer task matrices, are introduced as a way to analyze and leverage the structural information within neural network layers.\n*   Task matrices are shown to be inherently low-rank, enabling effective compression (TSV-C) with minimal accuracy loss.\n*   A novel model merging approach (TSV-M) is proposed that combines low-rank approximation with interference reduction by decorrelating TSVs, leading to significant performance improvements.\n*   TSV-M effectively reduces task interference, which is empirically shown to be crucial for successful model merging.",
