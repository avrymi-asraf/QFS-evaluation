SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces a novel multi-stage knowledge distillation framework designed to fuse knowledge from heterogeneous state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding models into a smaller student model. The core methodology involves a three-loss function approach: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. These losses progressively guide the student model to learn from teacher models, moving from specific vector alignment to broader semantic and ranking preferences. To handle the high dimensionality resulting from concatenating multiple teacher vectors, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed for effective dimension reduction. The framework is structured in four stages, including initial distillation from two large teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5), dimension reduction, and a preliminary stage for multimodal alignment. The resulting student model, Jasper (2B parameters), built upon Stella, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of this multi-teacher distillation approach for creating efficient yet powerful embedding models.\n\n2.

Stages 1 and 2 focus on this distillation, with Stage 1 training only a fully connected layer (FC1) and Stage 2 additionally training the last three encoder layers. A significant challenge addressed is the high vector dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher embeddings (initially 12,288 dimensions). Stage 3 utilizes Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional FC layers (FC2, FC3, FC4) to reduce dimensionality, for example, to 512 dimensions, while ensuring accuracy with the original concatenated vectors. Stage 4 employs self-distillation for preliminary multimodal alignment between text and image embeddings.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper proposes a multi-stage knowledge distillation framework to train a smaller student embedding model, Jasper, from multiple larger, state-of-the-art teacher models, specifically NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5. The distillation process utilizes three carefully designed losses: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss, progressing from specific to broader alignment. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from teachers, with Stage 1 training only a fully connected layer (FC1) and Stage 2 additionally training the last three encoder layers of the student model. Due to the high vector dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher outputs (e.g., 4096 + 8192 = 12288 dimensions), Stage 3 employs Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional FC layers to reduce dimensionality to more manageable sizes like 512. Stage 4 uses self-distillation to align multimodal (vision-language) embeddings. Jasper, with 2 billion parameters, achieves a strong performance on the MTEB leaderboard, ranking third and demonstrating results comparable to 7B parameter models, significantly outperforming other models in its parameter scale.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper details a novel multi-stage knowledge distillation framework, named Jasper, designed to fuse knowledge from heterogeneous, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher embedding models (specifically NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5) into a smaller student model. The framework employs three carefully designed losses: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss, progressing from specific to broader semantic alignment. Initially, in Stages 1 and 2, the student model's vectors are mapped and trained to align with concatenated teacher vectors (4096 + 8192 = 12288 dimensions). Stage 3 addresses the impractical dimensionality of these concatenated vectors by using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers to reduce them to manageable sizes (e.g., 512 dimensions), while still utilizing similarity-based losses. Stage 4 introduces self-distillation for preliminary multimodal alignment using image-caption pairs. The resulting Jasper model, with 2 billion parameters, achieves a high average score (71.54) on the MTEB leaderboard, comparable to larger 7B parameter models, and significantly outperforms other models in its parameter class. The differences in parameter training between Stage 1 (only FC layer) and Stage 2 (FC layer and last three encoder layers) are crucial for progressive knowledge transfer.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper utilizes a multi-stage distillation framework with three losses (cosine, similarity, relative similarity) to transfer knowledge from heterogeneous teacher models (NV-Embed-v2, Stella_en_1.5B_v5).\n*   The student model's vector dimension is initially concatenated from teachers (12288) and then reduced using MRL in Stage 3 to more practical sizes (e.g., 512).\n*   Jasper, a 2B parameter model, achieves performance comparable to 7B models on MTEB, outperforming smaller models.\n*   Stage 1 trains only the initial FC layer, while Stage 2 trains the FC layer and the last three encoder layers for progressive knowledge absorption.\n*   Stage 4 employs self-distillation for initial multimodal alignment, aligning image embeddings with text embeddings.",
