SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates the impact of student initialization proximity to the teacher in self-distillation, particularly when the teacher is randomly initialized rather than trained. The study found that even with a random teacher and no data augmentation, the student model exhibits significant learning. Crucially, initializing the student model *close* to the teacher's parameters, controlled by a locality parameter $\\alpha$, amplifies this implicit regularization. As $\\alpha$ increases (meaning the student is initialized further from the teacher), convergence slows down, and overall performance degrades, though even independent initialization still yields improvements over the random teacher. This locality effect suggests that the process of feature learning is strongly enhanced when the student begins its training journey in close proximity to the teacher's initial state. This phenomenon is visualized as an asymmetric valley in the loss landscape, where starting near the teacher allows the student to exploit this structure for better generalization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Initializing the student model closely to the randomly initialized teacher significantly amplifies the implicit regularization present in the learning dynamics.\n*   Increasing the distance (via locality parameter $\\alpha$) between the student's initialization and the teacher's initialization leads to slower convergence and worse overall probing performance.\n*   Even when initialized independently of the teacher ($\\alpha = 1$), the student still shows considerable improvement over the random teacher, demonstrating that representation learning can occur in self-distillation without relying on a trained teacher or dark knowledge.\n*   The beneficial effect of close initialization is linked to an observed asymmetric valley in the loss landscape, which the student can exploit for better generalization when starting nearby.",
