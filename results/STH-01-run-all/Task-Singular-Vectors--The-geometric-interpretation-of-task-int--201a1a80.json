The core idea is to analyze per-layer task matrices using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to obtain \"Task Singular Vectors\" (TSVs). The research demonstrates that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs captures most of the task-specific information. This observation leads to TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a method that compresses task vectors significantly while retaining high accuracy. Crucially, the paper proposes a new measure of task interference based on the alignment of TSVs from different tasks. By understanding this geometric interaction, TSV-Merge (TSV-M) is developed, which combines compression with interference reduction through a whitening transformation of TSVs. This method significantly outperforms existing model merging techniques by explicitly addressing and mitigating task interference.\n\n2.

              "answer": "The paper suggests that higher interference in initial layers is because these layers capture common features across tasks, leading to potential conflicts. In deeper layers, tasks become more specialized, reducing shared representations and thus interference. This is interpreted through the alignment of singular vectors, where more overlap in early layers signifies greater potential for interference."
