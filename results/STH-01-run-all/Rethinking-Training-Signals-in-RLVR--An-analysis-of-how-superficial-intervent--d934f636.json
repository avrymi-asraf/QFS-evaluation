SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates how Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can elicit complex reasoning behaviors in language models, even when provided with \"spurious\" or weak reward signals. The research found that for certain models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, RLVR training with rewards that have little to no correlation with the correct answer (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, or format-based rewards) can lead to significant performance improvements on mathematical reasoning tasks. This effect is attributed to RLVR's ability to surface and amplify latent reasoning capabilities acquired during pre-training. A key observation is that Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong propensity for \"code reasoning\" (using Python code to assist in problem-solving), which is significantly boosted by RLVR, even with spurious rewards. This phenomenon is not universal; other model families like Llama and OLMo show minimal or negative gains with spurious rewards, highlighting the model-dependent nature of RLVR's effectiveness and the importance of pre-training priors. The study suggests that future RLVR research should be validated across diverse models to avoid drawing conclusions based on model-specific behaviors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in models like Qwen2.5-Math even with spurious rewards (random, incorrect labels, format-based).\n*   These improvements are largely due to RLVR surfacing and amplifying pre-existing reasoning capabilities, such as \"code reasoning\" (using Python to solve math problems) in Qwen2.5-Math models.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards in RLVR is highly model-dependent; other model families (Llama, OLMo) do not benefit similarly.\n*   The study emphasizes the importance of pre-training data distribution in determining a model's response to RLVR, especially with weak or noisy reward signals.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse model architectures and families to ensure generalizability.",
