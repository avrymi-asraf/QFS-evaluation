The core finding is that even without any \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or explicit data augmentation, a student model can learn meaningful representations. These learned representations are shown to be data-dependent, as demonstrated by their performance degrading significantly when trained on random inputs and improving with larger datasets. Furthermore, the representations exhibit transferability across different tasks, indicating they capture generalizable features. The study also reveals that initializing the student closely to the random teacher amplifies this representation learning process. Intriguingly, these randomly distilled students develop sparse subnetworks and reside at the edge of linear basins in the loss landscape, mirroring phenomena observed in early stages of supervised training, but achieved without label information.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Learned representations are data-dependent, deteriorating significantly when trained on random inputs and improving with increased sample size.\n*   Representations learned through random teacher distillation are transferable between different tasks.\n*   The quality of learned representations is amplified when the student is initialized closely to the random teacher.\n*   Students distilled from random teachers develop sparse subnetworks and lie on the border of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, even without label supervision.",
