SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a novel embedding model that utilizes a multi-stage distillation framework to learn from multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher embedding models. The core of this approach is knowledge distillation, where a smaller student model (Jasper) effectively learns from larger, more powerful models. This process is guided by three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. These losses progressively shift from aligning individual text representations to matching semantic similarities between text pairs and finally to preserving relative ranking information, thereby acting as a mechanism for post-hoc modality alignment. To address the challenge of high vector dimensionality in SOTA models, Jasper incorporates Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to reduce dimensionality. The framework also includes a stage for unlocking multimodal potential through self-distillation, aligning visual embeddings with textual embeddings. Jasper, built upon the Stella embedding model, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models while only having 2B parameters, demonstrating the effectiveness of this distillation strategy for efficient and powerful embedding models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a multi-stage knowledge distillation framework to learn from multiple SOTA teacher embedding models.\n*   The distillation process uses three distinct loss functions (cosine, similarity, and relative similarity) to align representations post-hoc.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is used to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model.\n*   A self-distillation mechanism is utilized in the final stage to align visual and textual embeddings, enabling multimodal capabilities.\n*   Jasper, a 2B parameter model, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark.",

This process involves three carefully designed loss functions (cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss) to align student and teacher representations. Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is used to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model. The Jasper model, built upon the Stella embedding model with 2 billion parameters, achieves impressive results on the MTEB leaderboard, ranking third and demonstrating performance comparable to 7B parameter models. Stage 4 of the training process focuses on unlocking multimodal potential by using a vision encoder and a self-distillation mechanism. In this stage, caption embeddings serve as teacher vectors for image embeddings (student vectors), aligning visual and textual modalities. However, this stage is described as a preliminary alignment with significant room for improvement in future work, particularly concerning the vision encoder's capabilities and the observed oscillatory behavior in the loss function.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper utilizes a multi-stage distillation process with three loss functions to transfer knowledge from multiple large teacher models to a smaller student model.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed for effective dimension reduction of the student model's embeddings.\n*   The Jasper model (2B parameters) achieves competitive performance on the MTEB benchmark, comparable to larger 7B parameter models.\n*   Stage 4 involves self-distillation for modality alignment, using text embeddings as teachers for image embeddings, although it's noted as a preliminary step with potential for improvement.",
