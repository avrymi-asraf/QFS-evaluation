SUMMARY:\nThis article introduces rStar-Math, a novel approach that enables small language models (SLMs) to achieve state-of-the-art math reasoning capabilities without relying on distillation from larger, more powerful models. Instead, rStar-Math utilizes a \"self-evolution\" process powered by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a process preference model (PPM). The core innovation lies in its ability to self-generate high-quality training data, specifically step-by-step reasoning trajectories that are verified using code execution. This method iteratively refines both a policy SLM and a PPM over several rounds, progressively improving the model's ability to tackle increasingly complex math problems. The approach demonstrates that SLMs can effectively generate their own advanced training data, offering a viable alternative to knowledge distillation. Experiments show that rStar-Math significantly boosts the performance of various SLMs, even surpassing leading proprietary models like OpenAI's o1 on challenging benchmarks, thereby validating the efficacy of self-evolution for creating state-of-the-art training datasets.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   rStar-Math enables small language models (SLMs) to achieve state-of-the-art math reasoning without distillation, by using a self-evolutionary process with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).\n*   The method generates high-quality, step-by-step reasoning trajectories through code-augmented data synthesis, verifying each step's correctness.\n*   A novel process preference model (PPM) is trained to provide fine-grained feedback, guiding the MCTS and improving data quality over four rounds of self-evolution.\n*   This self-generation of training data proves to be a viable alternative to knowledge distillation, allowing SLMs to surpass larger models on math reasoning benchmarks.\n*   The approach demonstrates that SLMs can effectively create their own advanced training datasets, leading to significant performance gains.",
