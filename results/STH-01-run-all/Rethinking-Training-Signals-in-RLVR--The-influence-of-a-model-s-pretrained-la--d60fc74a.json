SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how a model's inherent, pre-trained latent abilities influence the outcomes of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), even when the reward signals are weak or spurious. The study found that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models even with random, incorrect, or format-based rewards, achieving performance gains comparable to using ground truth rewards. Crucially, these spurious rewards did not yield similar improvements in other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, suggesting that the effectiveness of RLVR with weak signals is highly dependent on the model's pre-training. Specifically, Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong \"code reasoning\" behavior (generating Python code for mathematical thinking without execution), which becomes more frequent after RLVR and strongly correlates with performance gains. The study hypothesizes that RLVR, especially with spurious rewards, surfaces and upweights these latent reasoning abilities acquired during pre-training, rather than teaching entirely new skills.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can elicit significant mathematical reasoning improvements even with spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels) in Qwen2.5-Math models.\n*   These spurious rewards are largely ineffective on other model families (Llama3, OLMo2), indicating that pre-trained latent abilities are key to their success.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models demonstrate a strong \"code reasoning\" behavior (generating Python code for thinking), which is significantly amplified by RLVR and correlates with improved performance.\n*   The study hypothesizes that RLVR, particularly with weak signals, leverages and upweights existing reasoning patterns learned during pre-training, rather than teaching new capabilities.",
