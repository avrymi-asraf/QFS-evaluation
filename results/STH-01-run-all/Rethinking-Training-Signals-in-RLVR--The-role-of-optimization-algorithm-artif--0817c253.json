The core of the user's query lies in understanding how optimization algorithm artifacts, specifically the clipping mechanism in GRPO, enable training from pure noise. The research demonstrates that for Qwen2.5-Math models, RLVR with spurious rewards (like random or incorrect labels) can significantly improve performance. A key finding is that this improvement is not due to learning new capabilities but rather eliciting latent reasoning strategies already present in the pre-trained model. Specifically, Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong tendency to use Python code for reasoning (\"code reasoning\"), which correlates with higher accuracy. RLVR, particularly with the clipping mechanism in GRPO, amplifies this pre-existing code reasoning behavior. Experiments show that disabling GRPO's clipping mechanism prevents random rewards from inducing performance gains, highlighting clipping's role in creating a directional training signal from noise by favoring pre-existing high-probability behaviors. This mechanism allows the algorithm to effectively leverage the model's inherent strengths, even when the reward signal itself is uninformative.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   GRPO's clipping mechanism is crucial for enabling spurious and random rewards to create a directional training signal by amplifying pre-existing model behaviors.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models show significant performance gains with RLVR using spurious rewards, primarily by eliciting their inherent \"code reasoning\" capability.\n*   Disabling GRPO's clipping mechanism eliminates the performance benefits of random rewards, demonstrating that clipping bias is key to leveraging noisy signals.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards relies on the model's pre-trained reasoning strategies; clipping bias amplifies these strategies, which then correlate with correctness for certain models like Qwen2.5-Math.",

              "answer": "The clipping mechanism in GRPO introduces a bias in the expected gradients. Specifically, it leads to a non-zero expected gradient because the clipping operation itself creates an asymmetry in how gradients are calculated. When the importance ratio (ρt) falls outside the clipping range [1-ϵc, 1+ϵc], the gradient is either zeroed out or scaled, depending on the sign of the advantage (Â). This effectively creates a non-zero expected gradient even when Â is zero, thereby providing a directional training signal.
