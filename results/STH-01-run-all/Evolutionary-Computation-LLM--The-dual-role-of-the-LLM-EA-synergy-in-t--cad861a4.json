LLMs, with their vast knowledge and generative capabilities, can enhance EA's ability to identify and even generate code with vulnerabilities. Conversely, EAs can be used to optimize prompts for LLMs to test their security boundaries, such as through \"jailbreak attacks\" designed to elicit inappropriate responses from aligned LLMs. This adversarial application of LLM-EA synergy is crucial for robustly testing and improving the security of AI systems. The paper highlights that EA-based prompt engineering is employed for LLM security by automatically optimizing prompts for adversarial purposes, like jailbreak attacks, to uncover vulnerabilities and test the resilience of safety mechanisms.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs and EAs can be combined to automatically generate adversarial prompts (e.g., \"jailbreak attacks\") to test the security and alignment of LLMs.\n*   EA-based prompt engineering is used to discover prompts that can bypass safety measures and cause LLMs to generate undesirable outputs.\n*   This synergy is crucial for red-teaming LLMs and understanding their security vulnerabilities.\n*   The research in this area aims to improve the robustness and safety of LLM deployments by proactively identifying and mitigating potential security risks.",
