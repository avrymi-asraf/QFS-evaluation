SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"Linear Representation Hypothesis,\" proposing that high-level concepts in language models are represented as linear directions in vector spaces. It addresses the challenge of unifying the distinct input (embedding) and output (unembedding) representation spaces. The key to this unification is the introduction of a \"causal inner product.\" This specific inner product is defined by the property that causally separable concepts (those that can vary independently) are represented by orthogonal vectors. The authors prove that this causal inner product creates a Riesz isomorphism that maps the unembedding representation of a concept to its corresponding embedding representation. This unification means that geometric notions like similarity and projection, which depend on the inner product, can be applied consistently across both representation spaces. By estimating this causal inner product from the model's unembedding matrix and demonstrating its properties through experiments with LLaMA-2, the paper shows how it bridges the gap between input and output representations, enabling a more coherent understanding and manipulation of concepts within the model.\n\n2.
