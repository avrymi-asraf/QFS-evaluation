It establishes unified mechanisms for the lifecycle and cross-type transformation of three core memory types: parametric (encoded in weights), activation (transient states like KV-caches), and plaintext (external knowledge). The system introduces the MemCube as a standardized abstraction that tracks, fuses, and migrates heterogeneous memory, enabling structured access and governance across tasks and contexts. MemOS facilitates dynamic transformations, such as converting frequently accessed plaintext or activation memory into parametric forms for efficiency, or externalizing underutilized parameters into plaintext for flexibility. This memory-centric approach promotes continual adaptation, personalized intelligence, and cross-platform coordination by enabling memory evolution, recomposition, and fusion. MemOS aims to transform LLMs from static generators into continuously evolving, memory-equipped intelligent agents.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   MemOS unifies the lifecycle and transformation of parametric, activation, and plaintext memory in LLMs.\n*   The MemCube abstraction standardizes heterogeneous memory for tracking, fusion, and migration.\n*   MemOS enables cross-type memory transformations, e.g., Plaintext/Activation → Parametric for efficiency, and Parametric → Plaintext for flexibility.\n*   The system supports memory evolution, recomposition, and fusion to foster continual adaptation and long-term growth.\n*   MemOS aims to elevate LLMs into continuously evolving, memory-equipped intelligent agents.",
