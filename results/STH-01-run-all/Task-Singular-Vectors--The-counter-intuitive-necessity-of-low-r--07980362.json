      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper argues for the counter-intuitive necessity of low-rank approximation in effective interference reduction for model merging. Traditional methods like Task Arithmetic treat entire networks as flat vectors, ignoring structural information and leading to task interference. The authors propose a new approach using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on per-layer task matrices, revealing their inherently low-rank nature. They demonstrate that retaining only a small fraction of singular vectors (Task Singular Vectors or TSVs) can compress task information significantly (to 10% of original size) while preserving high accuracy (99%). Crucially, this low-rank space is leveraged to define a fine-grained measure of task interference based on the interaction of TSVs from different tasks. By discarding irrelevant TSVs and decorrelating the remaining ones through a whitening transformation, their proposed method, TSV-Merge (TSV-M), effectively reduces interference and outperforms existing state-of-the-art model merging techniques by a substantial margin, showcasing the power of low-rank approximations in mitigating interference.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Per-layer task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of singular vectors (TSVs) captures most of the task's information.\n*   Low-rank approximation is counter-intuitively essential for effective interference reduction in model merging, as it provides a compressed subspace where interference can be more precisely managed.\n*   The authors' method, TSV-Merge, combines low-rank compression with interference reduction by decorrelating TSVs, significantly outperforming existing methods.\n*   This approach demonstrates that focusing on the low-rank structure of task representations allows for both efficient compression and improved interference mitigation.",
