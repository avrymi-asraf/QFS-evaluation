SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the economic feasibility and effectiveness of using reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance reasoning capabilities in small language models (LLMs) compared to large ones. The researchers fine-tuned a 1.5-billion-parameter model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) under strict resource constraints (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24 hours) using a curated mathematical reasoning dataset of 7,000 samples. They adapted the GRPO algorithm and employed a rule-based reward system. The results demonstrate rapid reasoning improvements, with AMC23 accuracy increasing from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, surpassing a baseline model (o1-preview) at a significantly lower cost of $42 compared to thousands for larger models. While initial gains were substantial, challenges like optimization instability and length constraints emerged with prolonged training. The findings highlight RL's potential for cost-effective reasoning enhancement in small LLMs, offering a scalable alternative for resource-constrained environments.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reinforcement learning (RL) can significantly boost reasoning performance in small LLMs (1.5B parameters) under tight computational constraints.\n*   The approach achieved competitive reasoning scores (e.g., 80% on AMC23, 46.7% on AIME24) with minimal resources, costing only $42.\n*   This is a stark economic contrast to large-scale LLM reasoning enhancements, which cost thousands of dollars.\n*   Challenges such as optimization instability and length limitations were observed with extended training, suggesting trade-offs in prolonged fine-tuning.\n*   The study provides a cost-effective framework for developing reasoning-capable small LLMs, promoting accessibility in resource-limited settings.",
