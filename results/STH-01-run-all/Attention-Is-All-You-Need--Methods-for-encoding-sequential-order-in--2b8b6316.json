SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Transformer, a novel sequence transduction model that entirely eschews recurrence and convolutions, relying solely on attention mechanisms to capture sequential order. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that process sequences step-by-step, inherently limiting parallelization, the Transformer utilizes self-attention to relate all positions within a sequence simultaneously. This allows for significantly greater parallelization during training and reduces the computational path length between distant elements, facilitating the learning of long-range dependencies. Positional encodings, specifically sine and cosine functions, are added to the input embeddings to inject information about the relative or absolute positions of tokens, as the model itself has no inherent sense of order. The Transformer's architecture, featuring stacked self-attention and position-wise feed-forward networks, demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to recurrent and convolutional models on machine translation tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n* The Transformer model is built exclusively on attention mechanisms, discarding recurrence and convolutions to process sequential data.\n* Positional encodings (sine and cosine functions) are used to inject information about token order since the architecture lacks inherent sequential processing.\n* Self-attention allows all positions in a sequence to interact directly, reducing the path length for learning long-range dependencies compared to RNNs and convolutions.\n* This attention-based approach enables significantly more parallelization during training and achieves state-of-the-art results with reduced training time.",
