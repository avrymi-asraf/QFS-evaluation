SUMMARY:\nThis paper provides a formal geometric framework that unifies the \"subspace hypothesis\" of concept representation in LLMs with practical interpretation and control techniques like linear probing and activation steering. The authors formalize linear representation in two ways: as a subspace in the output (unembedding) space, linking it to measurement (linear probing), and as a subspace in the input (embedding) space, linking it to intervention (activation steering). A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which, when applied to unembedding representations, yields embedding representations. This unified geometric approach demonstrates that causally separable concepts are orthogonal in this space. The framework allows for the construction of probes and steering vectors using counterfactual pairs and is validated empirically on LLaMA-2, showing that concepts are indeed represented linearly and that the causal inner product respects semantic structure, enabling effective interpretation and control.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis\" by defining concepts as subspaces in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces of LLMs.\n*   It establishes connections between these formalizations and practical techniques: unembedding representations relate to linear probing (measurement), and embedding representations relate to activation steering (intervention).\n*   A novel \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which unifies embedding and unembedding representations, showing that causally separable concepts are orthogonal in this geometric space.\n*   Empirical results on LLaMA-2 confirm the existence of linear concept representations and demonstrate the utility of the causal inner product for both interpreting (probing) and controlling (steering) model behavior.",

It establishes a geometric framework that formally connects the subspace hypothesis (e.g., word2vec analogies) with practical techniques like linear probing and activation steering. The core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product\" that respects the semantic independence of concepts. This inner product unifies two formalizations of linear representation: the \"unembedding representation\" (connecting to measurement/linear probing) and the \"embedding representation\" (connecting to intervention/activation steering). The paper demonstrates that while the choice of inner product is not uniquely determined by model training (unidentifiability), a causal inner product can be estimated. This framework allows for the construction of intervention vectors directly from subspace representations, enabling controlled manipulation of model behavior. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these theoretical connections, showing that concepts are indeed represented linearly, the causal inner product respects semantic structure, and these representations can be used for both interpretation and control.\n\n2.

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper provides a geometric framework to formally connect the subspace hypothesis of linear representation (e.g., word2vec analogies) with practical techniques like linear probing and activation steering. It formalizes \"linear representation\" in two ways: as a subspace in the output (unembedding) space, which connects to measurement (linear probing), and as a subspace in the input (embedding) space, which connects to intervention (activation steering). The core of the framework is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which is necessary because the standard Euclidean inner product is unidentifiable and doesn't respect semantic structure. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, enabling the construction of intervention vectors directly from subspace representations derived from counterfactual word pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of these linear representations and validate the connections to interpretation and control, emphasizing the crucial role of the chosen inner product.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis\" by defining concepts as linear subspaces in either the input (embedding) or output (unembedding) spaces of language models.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced as a principled way to define geometric notions (like similarity and projection) in representation spaces, overcoming the unidentifiability of the Euclidean inner product and ensuring that causally separable concepts are orthogonal.\n*   Theorem 3.2 establishes that this causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, meaning that the embedding representation of a concept can be derived from its unembedding representation through this specific inner product.\n*   The research demonstrates how to construct intervention vectors (used for activation steering) directly from these unified subspace representations, bridging the gap between theoretical linear models and practical control techniques.",
