The authors introduce counterfactuals as a formal language to precisely define what \"linear representation\" means in both the input (context) and output (word) spaces of language models. They demonstrate that these counterfactual-based definitions connect to established notions of linear probing (measurement) and model steering (intervention), respectively. A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" an inner product that treats causally separable concepts as orthogonal. This specific inner product is shown to unify the input and output representations of concepts, providing a geometric framework to understand their relationships. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these formalizations, showing that concept directions derived from counterfactuals align with model behavior for interpretation and control, and that the causal inner product respects the semantic structure of language.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactuals are used to formally define linear representations in both input (context) and output (word) spaces of language models.\n*   These counterfactual-based definitions link to established concepts of linear probing (measurement) and model steering (intervention).\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which formalizes the idea that causally separable concepts should be orthogonal in the representation space.\n*   This causal inner product unifies the input and output representations of concepts, providing a geometric foundation for understanding them.\n*   Empirical results with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of linear representations and the utility of the causal inner product for interpretation and control.",
