SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the efficacy of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically a 1.5-billion-parameter model, under strict resource constraints. The study adapts the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and a curated, compact mathematical reasoning dataset. The primary challenge explored is managing multilingual language drift when fine-tuning a foundational model for a monolingual reasoning task. Experiments reveal that while RL can lead to rapid reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%), prolonged training and strict length constraints can cause performance degradation and unintended language drift. The researchers found that mixing easier and harder problems, along with using a cosine reward to control output length, improved early performance and training stability. However, the multilingual nature of the base model remained a challenge, necessitating explicit language controls or longer completion limits for complex tasks. The study concludes that RL-based fine-tuning offers a cost-effective alternative for small LLMs, but careful consideration of data, reward design, and model characteristics is crucial to mitigate issues like language drift.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reinforcement learning (RL) can significantly improve the reasoning abilities of small LLMs (1.5B parameters) under tight resource constraints (4 GPUs, 24 hours).\n*   Prolonged training or strict output length limits can lead to performance degradation and unintended multilingual language drift in the fine-tuned model.\n*   Mixing easier and harder problems in the training data, combined with a cosine reward for length control, enhances early performance and training stability.\n*   The inherent multilingual nature of the base model poses a challenge for achieving purely monolingual reasoning, requiring specific strategies to mitigate language drift.\n*   The approach offers a cost-effective ($42) and data-efficient (7,000 samples) method for enhancing small LLM reasoning compared to resource-intensive baselines.",
