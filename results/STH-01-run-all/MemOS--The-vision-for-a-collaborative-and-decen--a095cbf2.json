Its core vision is to elevate memory to a first-class operational resource, unifying the management of parametric, activation, and plaintext memory types. By introducing the \"Memory Cube\" (MemCube) as a standardized abstraction, MemOS enables the tracking, fusion, and migration of heterogeneous memory across tasks and contexts. This memory-centric execution framework fosters strong controllability, adaptability, and evolvability. The system aims to break down \"memory silos\" between agents, users, and applications, facilitating continuous adaptation, personalized intelligence, and cross-platform coordination. Looking ahead, MemOS envisions a decentralized memory marketplace for shared knowledge and collaborative evolution, enabling LLMs to transition from static generators to continuously evolving intelligent agents with long-term memory.\n\n2.
