SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the implicit regularization induced by teacher-student learning dynamics in self-distillation, specifically using random initializations for teachers to isolate this effect. The core finding is that even with a randomly initialized teacher, a student model can learn meaningful representations and even surpass its teacher in representational quality, as measured by linear probing accuracy. This occurs without relying on \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher or data augmentations. The study reveals that the initial proximity between the student and teacher parameters significantly amplifies this learning process, suggesting a beneficial locality effect in the loss landscape. The student's learned representations are found to be data-dependent and transferable to other tasks. Furthermore, the student checkpoints exhibit characteristics similar to lottery tickets, residing on the edge of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, implying that label-independent optimization dynamics can indeed explore the loss landscape.\n\n2.

This indicates that initializing the student close to the teacher (low α) is beneficial, supporting the importance of the local geometry."
