      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThe article \"Jasper and Stella: distillation of SOTA embedding models\" outlines a novel multi-stage distillation framework designed to train smaller, more efficient embedding models from larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) ones. The rationale behind this staged approach is to overcome the practical limitations of SOTA embedding models, which often suffer from high parameter counts and vector dimensionality, leading to slow inference and high storage costs. The framework employs three carefully designed loss functions—cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss—to progressively transfer knowledge from multiple teacher models to a student model. This staged process allows for a controlled transfer of information, moving from specific alignment (cosine loss) to broader semantic understanding (similarity loss) and relative ranking (relative similarity distillation loss). This multi-stage methodology ensures a more effective and robust distillation, enabling the student model to achieve performance comparable to much larger models while remaining computationally efficient. Furthermore, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is integrated in a later stage to manage the high dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher outputs, and a final stage aims to unlock multimodal capabilities.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The staged training methodology addresses the practical limitations of large, high-dimensional SOTA embedding models by enabling smaller student models to distill knowledge from them.\n*   The framework utilizes a progression of three loss functions (cosine, similarity, and relative similarity distillation) to transfer knowledge from specific to broader semantic and ranking aspects.\n*   This multi-stage approach allows for effective knowledge transfer and robust embedding learning, leading to efficient student models that can match the performance of larger counterparts.\n*   Subsequent stages incorporate Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for dimension reduction and a final stage for multimodal alignment, demonstrating a comprehensive strategy for developing high-performing, compact embedding models.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThe Jasper model employs a four-stage distillation methodology to train a smaller student embedding model using larger state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models. The primary rationale behind this staged approach is to progressively transfer knowledge from powerful, albeit large, teachers to a more efficient student model, while also addressing practical deployment challenges like high dimensionality. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from two teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5), initially mapping student vectors to a combined dimension of 12,288. Stage 1 trains only a fully connected layer (FC1), whereas Stage 2 expands training to include the last three encoder layers of the student model. Stage 3 tackles the issue of the impractically large 12,288-dimensional vector by using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers (FC2, FC3, FC4) for dimension reduction, allowing the generation of lower-dimensional vectors. In Stage 4, the focus shifts to unlocking multimodal potential by training the visual encoder using image-caption pairs, where the caption's vector serves as the teacher and the image's vector as the student. This multi-stage process allows for efficient knowledge transfer, dimensionality reduction, and multimodal capability development.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The distillation process involves a total of four stages.\n*   After mapping, student vectors achieve a dimension of 12,288 to align with concatenated teacher vectors.\n*   Stage 1 trains only FC1, while Stage 2 trains FC1 and the last three encoder layers.\n*   Stage 3 addresses the high vector dimension problem using MRL and additional FC layers for compression.\n*   In Stage 4, image vectors act as students and caption vectors act as teachers for visual encoder training.",

This process involves a total of four distinct stages, designed to progressively transfer knowledge. Initially, in stages 1 and 2, the student model learns from two teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5) using a progression of loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. Stages 1 and 2 differ in the parameters trained, with stage 1 focusing on a fully connected layer (FC1) and stage 2 expanding to include the last three encoder layers. After these stages, the student model's vectors are mapped to a dimensionality of 12,288. To address the issue of this impractically large vector dimension, stage 3 utilizes Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected (FC) layers (FC2, FC3, FC4) to compress the vectors, focusing on the similarity and relative similarity losses for these compressed outputs while continuing to train FC1 with all three losses. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by focusing on training the visual encoder using self-distillation, where caption vectors act as teacher vectors and image vectors act as student vectors, aiming for preliminary modality alignment. Jasper achieved a No.3 position on the MTEB leaderboard with an average score of 71.54 across 56 datasets, demonstrating performance comparable to 7B parameter models.\n\n2.

This process involves four distinct stages to progressively transfer knowledge and enhance performance. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling text representations from teachers like NV-Embed-v2 and Stella using a progression of loss functions: cosine loss for absolute representation alignment, similarity loss for text-pair semantic matching, and relative similarity distillation loss for ranking preferences. Stages 1 and 2 differ in the parameters trained, with Stage 1 focusing on a fully connected layer and Stage 2 expanding to include the last three encoder layers. A key challenge in Stages 1 & 2 was the high vector dimension (12,288) resulting from concatenating teacher vectors, which was addressed in Stage 3 using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers for effective dimension reduction. Stage 4 focuses on unlocking multimodal potential by training the visual encoder using self-distillation, where caption vectors act as teachers for image vectors, aiming for preliminary modality alignment. Jasper achieved a No. 3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating performance comparable to 7B parameter models with its 2B parameters.\n\n2.

This staged approach progressively transfers knowledge, starting with aligning student and teacher representations using a sequence of loss functions that move from specific (cosine loss) to broader (similarity and relative similarity loss). Stages 1 and 2 focus on this distillation, with Stage 2 incrementally training more parameters of the student model. A key challenge arises in Stages 1 & 2 from concatenating teacher vectors, leading to a large 12,288-dimensional output. Stage 3 addresses this through Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) using additional fully connected (FC) layers to compress vectors, while still training the initial 12,288-dimensional vectors with all three loss functions. Stage 4 focuses on unlocking multimodal capabilities by training the visual encoder using self-distillation, where caption vectors serve as teachers for image vectors. Jasper achieved No. 3 on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating performance comparable to 7B models with its 2B parameters.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper utilizes a four-stage distillation process to transfer knowledge from multiple large teacher models to a smaller student model.\n*   The distillation stages progress from specific (cosine loss) to broader constraints (similarity and relative similarity loss) to enhance learning.\n*   Stage 3 uses Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with FC layers to address the 12,288-dimensional vector issue arising from concatenating teacher outputs.\n*   Stage 4 trains the visual encoder using self-distillation, aligning image embeddings (student) with caption embeddings (teacher).\n*   Jasper achieved No. 3 on the MTEB leaderboard, showcasing competitive performance with larger models.",

The primary rationale for this staged approach is to progressively transfer knowledge from the teachers to the student, starting with specific alignment and moving to broader semantic and relative ranking understanding. Stages 1 and 2 focus on knowledge transfer, with Stage 1 training only a fully connected layer (FC1) and Stage 2 further training the last three encoder layers, both utilizing cosine loss (specific), similarity loss (text-pair perspective), and relative similarity distillation loss (ranking preferences). Stage 3 addresses the issue of excessively large vector dimensions (12,288) resulting from concatenating teacher vectors. This is solved using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional FC layers (FC2, FC3, FC4) to compress vectors, primarily using similarity and relative similarity losses. Stage 4 focuses on enabling multimodal capabilities by training the visual encoder using self-distillation, where caption vectors act as teachers and image vectors as students. This multi-stage process allows Jasper to achieve performance comparable to larger models on the MTEB leaderboard.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The Jasper model utilizes a 4-stage distillation process to transfer knowledge from larger teacher models to a smaller student model.\n*   Stages 1 and 2 progressively train the student model using cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss, moving from specific to broader alignment.\n*   Stage 3 addresses the high dimensionality (12,288) from teacher vector concatenation by employing MRL with FC layers for compression.\n*   Stage 4 focuses on multimodal training by using caption vectors as teachers and image vectors as students via self-distillation.\n*   Jasper achieves state-of-the-art performance for its size on the MTEB leaderboard, comparable to larger 7B parameter models.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThe Jasper model employs a four-stage distillation methodology to train a smaller student embedding model using multiple larger state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models. The rationale behind this staged approach is to progressively transfer knowledge and refine the student model's capabilities. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling text representations from teacher models like NV-Embed-v2 and Stella, utilizing a progression of loss functions: cosine loss for specific alignment, similarity loss for broader semantic matching, and relative similarity distillation loss for ranking preferences. Stage 1 trains only a fully connected layer, while Stage 2 expands training to include the last three encoder layers, enabling incremental learning. The primary challenge addressed in Stage 3 is the impractically large vector dimension (12,288) resulting from concatenating teacher vectors. This is solved using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers to compress the output to manageable dimensions, while retaining the initial 12,288-dimensional vectors for continued training with all three loss functions. Stage 4 focuses on unlocking multimodal potential by training the vision encoder using self-distillation, where caption vectors serve as teachers and image vectors as students. Jasper achieves strong performance, securing the No. 3 position on the MTEB leaderboard with an average score of 71.54, comparable to 7B parameter models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The training process is divided into four stages, designed to progressively transfer knowledge from larger teacher models to a smaller student model.\n*   Stages 1 and 2 use a combination of cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss to guide the student model, progressing from specific to broader semantic alignment.\n*   Stage 3 addresses the issue of a 12,288-dimensional vector output (from concatenating teacher vectors) by using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with fully connected layers for dimension reduction.\n*   Stage 4 focuses on multimodal training by using self-distillation, with caption vectors acting as teachers and image vectors as students, to train the vision encoder.\n*   Jasper, with 2 billion parameters, achieved the No. 3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating performance comparable to larger 7B parameter models.",

The rationale behind this staged approach is to progressively transfer knowledge and refine the student model's capabilities. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling text representations from multiple teachers (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5) using a progression of loss functions: cosine loss for aligning absolute representations, similarity loss for semantic matching, and relative similarity distillation loss for ranking preferences. Stage 1 trains only a fully connected layer (FC1), while Stage 2 expands training to include the last three encoder layers of the student model, allowing for deeper adaptation. The primary challenge in these stages is the high dimensionality (12,288) resulting from concatenating teacher vectors. Stage 3 addresses this by using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers (FC2, FC3, FC4) to compress vectors to lower dimensions, using only similarity and relative similarity losses for the compressed outputs. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by training the vision encoder using self-distillation, where caption embeddings serve as teacher vectors and image embeddings as student vectors. This multi-stage process allows Jasper, a 2B parameter model, to achieve performance comparable to 7B models on the MTEB leaderboard.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The training is structured into four stages to progressively transfer knowledge and refine the student model's capabilities.\n*   Stages 1 and 2 utilize a progression of loss functions (cosine, similarity, relative similarity) to move from specific to broader representation alignment.\n*   Stage 3 addresses the 12,288-dimensional output issue from teacher vector concatenation by employing MRL and additional FC layers for dimension reduction.\n*   Stage 4 focuses on training the vision encoder using self-distillation, aligning image embeddings with caption embeddings.\n*   Jasper achieved a No. 3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating performance comparable to 7B parameter models despite being a 2B parameter model.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThe Jasper model employs a four-stage distillation methodology to train a smaller embedding model from larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teachers. The rationale behind this staged approach is to progressively transfer knowledge, starting with specific representations and moving towards broader semantic understanding. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from multiple teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5) using a progression of loss functions: cosine loss (specific, single text representation alignment), similarity loss (text-pair perspective), and relative similarity distillation loss (ranking preferences). Stage 1 trains only a fully connected layer (FC1), while Stage 2 additionally trains the last three encoder layers of the student model, allowing for incremental parameter learning. The primary problem in Stages 1 and 2 is the high vector dimensionality (12,288) resulting from concatenating teacher vectors. Stage 3 addresses this by using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers (FC2, FC3, FC4) to compress the vector dimension. In Stage 4, the focus shifts to multimodal training, using image-caption pairs for self-distillation where caption vectors act as teachers and image vectors as students, primarily training the vision encoder. Jasper achieved an average MTEB score of 71.54 across 56 datasets, ranking third and performing comparably to 7B parameter models despite its 2B parameters.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper utilizes a 4-stage distillation process to transfer knowledge from multiple large teacher models to a smaller student model, progressing from specific to broader semantic understanding.\n*   Stages 1 and 2 employ a sequence of loss functions (cosine, similarity, relative similarity) to guide the student, with Stage 1 training only an initial FC layer and Stage 2 expanding to include the last three encoder layers.\n*   The 12,288-dimensional vector output from concatenating teacher models in Stages 1 and 2 presents a dimensionality issue, which Stage 3 resolves using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional FC layers for compression.\n*   Stage 4 focuses on multimodal alignment through self-distillation, using caption vectors as teachers for image vectors to train the vision encoder.\n*   Jasper achieves competitive performance on the MTEB leaderboard, ranking third with a 71.54 average score, comparable to larger 7B models.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThe Jasper model employs a multi-stage distillation methodology to train a smaller student embedding model from larger state-of-the-art teachers. This process involves a total of four stages. Stages 1 and 2 focus on knowledge transfer using three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (specific constraint), similarity loss (text-pair perspective), and relative similarity distillation loss (relative ranking information). Stage 1 trains only a fully connected layer, while Stage 2 additionally trains the last three encoder layers of the student model, incrementally expanding the scope of learned parameters. The primary challenge in Stage 3 is the impractical 12,288-dimensional vector output resulting from concatenating teacher vectors. This is solved using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers to generate lower-dimensional vectors. Stage 4 focuses on multimodal training by training the visual encoder, using the caption's vector representation as the teacher and the image's vector representation as the student. Jasper achieves impressive performance, securing the No. 3 position on the MTEB leaderboard with a 2B parameter model, comparable to 7B parameter models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The training process consists of a total of four distillation stages.\n*   Stages 1 and 2 progressively transfer knowledge using cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss, moving from specific to broader constraints. Stage 1 trains only a FC layer, while Stage 2 trains FC and the last three encoder layers.\n*   Stage 3 addresses the issue of a 12,288-dimensional vector output by using MRL with FC layers for dimension reduction.\n*   Stage 4 trains the visual encoder, using caption vectors as teachers and image vectors as students for multimodal alignment.\n*   Jasper model achieved the No. 3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, with performance comparable to 7B parameter models.",
