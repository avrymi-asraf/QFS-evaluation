The authors argue that high scores on these benchmarks often mask an overreliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than genuine language understanding. To address this, they introduce the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework that systematically distorts benchmark prompts by rephrasing them while preserving semantic content. This method aims to detect if a model's performance is driven by memorized patterns. Their experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 leading LLMs revealed an average performance degradation of 2.15% under modest perturbations, with 20 out of 26 models showing statistically significant differences. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy tended to be more sensitive to these rephrasings, suggesting they over-rely on fixed prompt patterns. The findings challenge the community to move beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper critiques the current leaderboard-centric evaluation culture in NLP, arguing that high scores on public benchmarks often mask an overreliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. The authors introduce the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD) framework, which systematically distorts benchmark prompts to detect this overfitting. Their experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs revealed that most models exhibit a significant performance degradation (average of 2.15%) when prompts are rephrased while preserving semantic content. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy showed greater performance drops, suggesting they are more susceptible to overfitting due to memorization of prompt patterns. Conversely, models with lower baseline accuracy and the Llama family demonstrated more resilience. The paper advocates for moving beyond leaderboard scores to prioritize resilience and generalization, suggesting C-BOD can be integrated into training pipelines to foster more robust language understanding.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Current LLM evaluations are criticized for prioritizing leaderboard scores, which can hide overreliance on superficial cues rather than genuine language understanding.\n*   The proposed C-BOD framework detects LLM overfitting by rephrasing benchmark prompts, revealing performance drops when surface patterns are altered.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher initial accuracy tend to exhibit greater performance degradation under prompt perturbations, indicating a stronger dependence on memorized patterns.\n*   The study suggests that models with lower baseline accuracy and specific families like Llama show more resilience to these prompt variations, implying less overfitting.\n*   The authors advocate for shifting evaluation focus from leaderboards to model resilience and generalization, with C-BOD offering a tool to achieve this.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper critiques the prevalent leaderboard-centric evaluation culture in NLP, arguing that high scores on public benchmarks often mask an overreliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. The authors introduce the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework that systematically distorts benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic content. This method aims to detect \"overfitting\" where LLMs' performance is driven by memorized patterns. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 leading LLMs revealed an average performance degradation of 2.15% under modest perturbations, with 20 models showing statistically significant drops. Crucially, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy exhibited greater performance degradation, suggesting they are more sensitive to prompt rephrasing and potentially overfit to fixed prompt patterns. The paper highlights that this overfitting can be mitigated by integrating prompt rephrasing into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding, urging the community to move beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize resilience.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Leaderboard scores can be misleading, as LLMs may overfit to dataset-specific surface cues instead of demonstrating genuine understanding.\n*   The C-BOD framework detects overfitting by systematically rephrasing benchmark prompts and measuring performance degradation, revealing that 20 out of 26 tested LLMs showed statistically significant performance drops.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to exhibit greater performance degradation under prompt perturbations, indicating a stronger reliance on surface-level patterns.\n*   The paper advocates for integrating prompt rephrasing into LLM training to mitigate overfitting and promote more robust, generalized language understanding, moving beyond a sole focus on leaderboard performance.",
