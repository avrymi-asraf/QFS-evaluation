The core idea is to enrich training data by adding a \"reflection\" section to existing problem-solution pairs. This reflection section comprises two parts: alternative reasoning (presenting a different method to solve the same problem) and follow-up reasoning (generalizing the problem or applying its concepts to a new, more complex scenario). Unlike traditional data augmentation that focuses on increasing the quantity of diverse problems, RefAug aims to deepen the model's understanding of each problem. Experiments show that RefAug significantly improves performance on both standard single-round math problems and more complex reflective reasoning tasks, such as follow-up questions and error correction. Furthermore, RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, leading to even greater gains when combined. The method also demonstrates efficacy in code generation tasks, indicating its broader applicability in tasks requiring logical reasoning.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by adding \"alternative\" and \"follow-up\" reasoning sections to training data, promoting deeper problem understanding.\n*   RefAug significantly improves performance on both standard single-round math problems and complex reflective reasoning tasks, where traditional data expansion methods fall short.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, yielding synergistic performance gains when combined.\n*   The method is effective in code generation tasks, demonstrating its generalizability to other areas requiring logical reasoning.\n*   RefAug's benefits stem from fostering a deeper comprehension of mathematical concepts and methodologies, rather than just increasing data volume.",
