SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the efficacy of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small large language models (LLMs) under significant computational constraints. The researchers fine-tuned a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, using a curated mathematical reasoning dataset and the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. The experiments revealed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements within the first 50-100 training steps, even with limited data and computational resources (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24 hours, $42 cost). However, prolonged training led to performance degradation and instability, particularly due to length constraints and the model's multilingual nature. While a cosine reward helped stabilize output lengths, it slightly reduced peak performance. The findings highlight the potential of RL for cost-effective reasoning enhancement in small LLMs but also underscore challenges related to optimization stability and the need for careful management of output length constraints for complex reasoning tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reinforcement learning (RL) can significantly improve the reasoning abilities of small LLMs (1.5B parameters) under strict resource constraints (4 A40 GPUs, 24 hours, $42 cost).\n*   Rapid reasoning gains were observed within the first 50-100 training steps, with a 1.5B model achieving 80% accuracy on AMC23 and 46.7% on AIME24.\n*   Prolonged training beyond 100-200 steps led to performance degradation and optimization instability, particularly when output length constraints were present.\n*   A cosine reward function helped stabilize output lengths, improving training consistency, but extreme tasks still benefited from longer completion limits.\n*   The study demonstrates a cost-effective approach to enhancing LLM reasoning, challenging the necessity of massive datasets and computational resources typically used for larger models.",
