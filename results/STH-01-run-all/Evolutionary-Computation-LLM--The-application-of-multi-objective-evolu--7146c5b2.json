SUMMARY:\nThis survey extensively details the application of multi-objective evolutionary principles within the research landscape where Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) converge. It highlights how multi-objective optimization is integral to several key areas. In LLM-enhanced EA, multi-objective aspects are seen in prompt generation for data augmentation and LLM security, where multiple criteria like performance and robustness are optimized. For EA-enhanced LLM, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are explicitly used in prompt engineering to balance multiple objectives and in Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for conflicting goals like performance and latency. The paper also showcases applications where LLM and EA synergy tackles multi-objective problems, such as in software project planning (optimizing error, confidence interval, and example count) and various NAS tasks seeking Pareto fronts of accuracy and efficiency. The roadmap also points towards future work involving multi-modal LLMs for cross-domain EA optimization and more sophisticated EA-enhanced LLM capabilities, implicitly or explicitly involving multi-objective considerations.\n\n2.
