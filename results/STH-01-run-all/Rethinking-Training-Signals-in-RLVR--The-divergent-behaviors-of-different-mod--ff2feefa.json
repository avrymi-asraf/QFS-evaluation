The research highlights a significant lack of technique generalization, demonstrating that RLVR training signals, even spurious ones like incorrect labels or random rewards, can yield substantial performance improvements in Qwen2.5-Math models. However, these same signals often fail to produce similar gains or even degrade performance in Llama and OLMo models. This divergence is attributed to inherent differences in pre-training, with Qwen models exhibiting a unique \"code reasoning\" behavior (generating Python code for mathematical thinking) that RLVR can effectively elicit and amplify. For other models, this pre-existing reasoning capability is either absent or less beneficial, leading to minimal or negative impacts from RLVR with spurious rewards. The findings underscore the critical need to validate RLVR techniques on diverse model architectures due to their strong dependence on pre-trained behaviors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR training with spurious rewards (e.g., incorrect labels, random rewards) significantly improves Qwen2.5-Math models' performance.\n*   These same spurious rewards generally fail to yield gains or even degrade performance in Llama and OLMo models, indicating a lack of technique generalization.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is linked to pre-existing reasoning patterns within models, such as Qwen's \"code reasoning\" capability.\n*   The study emphasizes that RLVR outcomes are heavily influenced by base model pretraining, and findings from one model family may not apply to others.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse model architectures to account for these pre-training-dependent behaviors.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) in enhancing mathematical reasoning, particularly focusing on the divergent behaviors of different model families (Qwen, Llama, OLMo) under identical RLVR training conditions. The study reveals a fundamental lack of technique generalization, showing that spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format-based) can significantly improve Qwen2.5-Math models' performance, sometimes even matching ground truth rewards. However, these same spurious rewards yield minimal or negative gains on Llama and OLMo models, indicating that RLVR's success is highly dependent on the base model's pre-trained capabilities. A key factor identified is \"code reasoning\" – the ability to generate Python code for mathematical thought processes – which is prevalent in Qwen models and strongly correlates with performance gains under RLVR, even with spurious rewards. This suggests RLVR primarily elicits latent reasoning strategies rather than teaching new ones. The findings underscore the critical need to validate RLVR techniques across diverse model architectures and pre-training data distributions to avoid drawing conclusions based on model-specific behaviors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Spurious rewards significantly boost Qwen models' math reasoning via RLVR, but fail to generalize to Llama or OLMo models, highlighting a lack of technique generalization.\n*   \"Code reasoning\" (generating Python for thought) is a distinctive pre-trained capability in Qwen models that RLVR effectively elicits, leading to performance improvements even with uninformative rewards.\n*   RLVR primarily appears to amplify existing reasoning patterns learned during pre-training rather than imparting new capabilities.\n*   The study emphasizes the critical importance of validating RLVR methods on a diverse range of models, as conclusions drawn from Qwen models alone may not be representative.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with weak or spurious rewards is contingent on the base model's pre-existing reasoning strategies and their correlation with correctness.",

The research highlights a significant lack of technique generalization, demonstrating that RLVR methods, even with spurious or weak reward signals, yield substantial performance gains on Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math. These gains are often comparable to using ground truth rewards. However, these same spurious rewards fail to produce similar improvements, and sometimes even degrade performance, on Llama and OLMo models. This divergence is attributed to differences in pre-training, with Qwen models exhibiting a distinct \"code reasoning\" capability (generating Python code for mathematical reasoning without execution) that is effectively amplified by RLVR. The study emphasizes that RLVR primarily elicits pre-existing reasoning strategies rather than teaching new ones, and that validation should extend beyond Qwen models to understand the true generalization capabilities of RLVR techniques.\n\n2.

Experiments show that while RLVR, even with spurious or weak reward signals (e.g., incorrect labels, random rewards, format adherence), can dramatically improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, these same techniques often fail to yield similar gains on models like Llama3 and OLMo2. This divergence is strongly attributed to differences in pre-training. Specifically, Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a distinct \"code reasoning\" capability—generating Python code to aid their thought process without actual execution—which RLVR effectively amplifies. This code reasoning is highly correlated with performance gains in Qwen models, whereas other models either do not possess this capability or fail to benefit from it. The study emphasizes that RLVR primarily surfaces latent abilities present during pre-training, making its effectiveness highly model-dependent and highlighting the critical need for cross-model validation in RLVR research to avoid drawing conclusions based on a single model family.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR training with spurious rewards significantly improves Qwen2.5-Math models but shows minimal or negative gains on Llama3 and OLMo2 models, indicating a lack of technique generalization.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR is heavily influenced by pre-training, with Qwen2.5-Math models benefiting from their inherent \"code reasoning\" capability, which RLVR amplifies.\n*   Spurious rewards can elicit performance gains by leveraging pre-existing, beneficial reasoning strategies within a model, rather than teaching new ones.\n*   The study underscores the necessity of validating RLVR techniques across diverse model architectures and pre-training backgrounds to understand their true generalization capabilities.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness across different model families, highlighting a critical lack of technique generalization. The study reveals that while RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, even with spurious or weak reward signals (e.g., incorrect labels, random rewards, format adherence), these benefits do not transfer to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2. These other models show minimal or even negative performance gains when trained with the same spurious rewards. The research posits that this divergence is largely due to pre-training differences, particularly Qwen2.5-Math's strong propensity for \"code reasoning\" – generating Python code to assist in problem-solving. This pre-existing behavior in Qwen models is effectively amplified by RLVR, leading to performance improvements. Conversely, models lacking this code reasoning capability do not benefit from similar RLVR training. The findings underscore the necessity of validating RLVR techniques across diverse model architectures and pre-training strategies, rather than relying on a single model family like Qwen.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards significantly boosts performance in Qwen2.5-Math models but fails to generalize to Llama3 and OLMo2 models, indicating a lack of technique generalization.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is heavily influenced by pre-training, with Qwen models benefiting due to their pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capability.\n*   Code reasoning, the generation of Python code for problem-solving, is identified as a key pre-trained behavior in Qwen models that RLVR amplifies, leading to performance gains.\n*   Other model families (Llama3, OLMo2) do not exhibit this code reasoning behavior, and consequently, do not benefit from RLVR using spurious rewards.\n*   The study emphasizes the crucial need for cross-model validation in RLVR research to understand the true generalizability and limitations of these training techniques.",
