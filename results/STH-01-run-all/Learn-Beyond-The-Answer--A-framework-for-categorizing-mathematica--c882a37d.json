      "summary": "The article introduces \"Reflective Augmentation\" (RefAug), a novel training technique for language models (LMs) designed to improve mathematical reasoning skills. Unlike traditional data augmentation methods that simply increase the volume of training data, RefAug enriches each training instance by appending a \"reflective section\" to the original solution. This section, inspired by human learning, includes \"alternative reasoning\" (presenting a different approach to solve the same problem) and \"follow-up reasoning\" (generalizing the problem or applying its concepts to a more complex scenario).\n\nRefAug aims to foster a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and methodologies, moving beyond rote memorization of solutions. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance in standard single-round question-answering tasks and, crucially, excels in more complex reflective reasoning scenarios like follow-up questions and error correction, where traditional methods often fall short. The technique is shown to be complementary to existing augmentation strategies, leading to further performance gains when combined. RefAug also proves effective in code generation tasks, highlighting the general applicability of incorporating reflection into LM training.\n\n**KEY HIGHLIGHTS:**\n\n*   RefAug enhances LM mathematical reasoning by adding \"reflection\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) to training data, promoting deeper understanding.\n*   It significantly improves performance on complex reflective reasoning tasks, outperforming traditional data expansion methods.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing augmentation techniques, yielding synergistic performance gains.\n*   The method is effective for both mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks.\n*   RefAug enhances problem-solving capabilities without increasing inference time due to early stopping mechanisms.",

Moving past traditional data augmentation that simply increases the volume of training examples, RefAug embeds \"reflection\" into each training instance. This reflection takes two forms: \"alternative reasoning,\" which presents different valid approaches to solve a problem, and \"follow-up reasoning,\" which connects the problem to more general concepts or more complex scenarios through abstraction or analogy. Inspired by human learning strategies, RefAug aims to cultivate a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and methodologies. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance in standard single-round question-answering tasks, achieving a +7.2% accuracy gain.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel training technique designed to enhance mathematical reasoning capabilities in language models (LMs) by embedding problem reflection into training instances. Unlike traditional data augmentation methods that primarily expand the training set with more problems, RefAug focuses on enriching the sequence dimension of existing data. It appends a \"reflective section\" to the original solution, which includes \"alternative reasoning\" (exploring different solution paths) and \"follow-up reasoning\" (generalizing or extending the problem). This approach, inspired by human learning principles from Stacey et al. (1982), aims to cultivate a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and methodologies, moving beyond basic forward reasoning to more complex reflective capabilities. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance in standard single-round question-answering tasks, achieving a +7.2% accuracy gain. Crucially, RefAug shows remarkable effectiveness in more complex reflective reasoning scenarios, such as follow-up questions and error correction, where traditional augmentation methods fall short.

Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the training set size, RefAug enriches each training instance by appending a \"reflective section\" to the original solution. This section, inspired by Stacey et al. (1982)'s definition of reflection as \"to review thoughtfully, consider alternatives and follow extensions,\" comprises two components: alternative reasoning (presenting a different solution method) and follow-up reasoning (associating the problem with broader abstractions or analogies). RefAug aims to cultivate a deeper understanding of mathematical problems and enhance the model's ability to engage in complex reflective reasoning, which is crucial for tasks like error correction and multi-turn question answering. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance in standard single-round question-answering (QA) settings, achieving a +7.2% accuracy gain over direct fine-tuning. Crucially, its benefits are complementary to existing augmentation techniques, leading to synergistic performance improvements, particularly in challenging reflective reasoning scenarios where other methods fall short.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by embedding \"reflection\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data, promoting deeper understanding beyond basic forward reasoning.\n*   The technique achieves a notable +7.2% accuracy gain in standard single-round math QA tasks.\n*   RefAug demonstrates strong complementary benefits with existing data augmentation methods, leading to synergistic performance improvements, especially in complex reflective reasoning scenarios like error correction and follow-up QA.\n*   Its core components, alternative reasoning and follow-up reasoning (abstraction/analogy), are derived from the definition of reflection by Stacey et al. (1982).\n*   RefAug targets enhancing reflective capabilities, addressing a limitation where traditional augmentation methods primarily focus on single-round QA.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel training technique for language models (LMs) designed to enhance mathematical reasoning skills beyond basic forward reasoning. RefAug integrates \"reflection\" into each training instance by appending a reflective section to the original solution. Drawing from Stacey et al. (1982), this section comprises either \"alternative reasoning\" (presenting a different problem-solving approach) or \"follow-up reasoning\" (generalizing the problem through abstraction or analogy). This method targets the sequence dimension of training data, aiming for a deeper understanding of problems, rather than merely expanding the dataset size. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance in standard single-round question-answering (QA) settings, achieving a +7.2% accuracy gain. Crucially, RefAug excels in complex reflective reasoning scenarios, such as error correction and follow-up QA, where traditional data expansion methods fall short. Furthermore, RefAug is complementary to existing augmentation techniques, yielding synergistic performance improvements and enabling LMs to engage with more sophisticated mathematical tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by embedding \"reflection\" (alternative or follow-up reasoning) into training data, promoting deeper understanding.\n*   Achieves a +7.2% accuracy gain in standard single-round math QA tasks and significantly improves performance in complex reflective reasoning scenarios like error correction and follow-up QA.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation methods, leading to synergistic performance improvements.\n*   The approach is inspired by human learning principles (Stacey et al., 1982) and focuses on enhancing reasoning capabilities rather than simply increasing data volume.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel training technique for language models (LMs) designed to enhance mathematical reasoning skills beyond basic forward reasoning. Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands training sets with more problems, RefAug embeds \"reflection\" into each training instance by appending a reflective section to the original solution. This section comprises \"alternative reasoning\" (considering different problem-solving approaches) and \"follow-up reasoning\" (generalizing the problem or applying it to new contexts, using abstraction or analogy). Inspired by human learning, RefAug aims to foster a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and methodologies. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance in standard single-round question-answering tasks, achieving a +7.2% accuracy gain. Crucially, it substantially improves performance in complex reflective reasoning scenarios, such as error correction and follow-up question answering, where traditional methods fall short. RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing augmentation techniques, leading to synergistic performance gains and a more robust understanding of mathematical problems.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by embedding \"reflection\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data.\n*   It achieves a +7.2% accuracy gain in standard single-round math reasoning tasks.\n*   RefAug significantly improves performance in reflective reasoning scenarios like error correction and follow-up QA, outperforming traditional augmentation methods.\n*   The approach fosters a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and methodologies.\n*   RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, leading to synergistic performance improvements.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel training technique for language models (LMs) designed to enhance mathematical reasoning beyond basic forward steps. RefAug embeds \"reflection\" into each training instance by appending a section that includes either alternative reasoning approaches or follow-up reasoning scenarios (abstraction or analogy). This method, inspired by human learning principles, aims to foster a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and methodologies, moving beyond simple pattern matching. RefAug complements existing data augmentation techniques by improving performance not only in standard single-round question-answering (QA) settings (achieving a +7.2% accuracy gain) but also significantly boosting capabilities in more complex reflective reasoning tasks such as error correction and follow-up questions, where traditional methods often fall short. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug's benefits are synergistic with other augmentation methods, leading to greater overall performance improvements. The core idea is to train LMs to \"review thoughtfully, consider alternatives and follow extensions,\" as defined by Stacey et al. (1982), thereby cultivating more robust and flexible mathematical reasoning skills.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug embeds problem reflection (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data to enhance LM mathematical understanding.\n*   It achieves a +7.2% accuracy gain in standard single-round QA tasks and significantly improves performance in reflective reasoning scenarios like error correction and follow-up QA.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation methods, leading to synergistic performance gains.\n*   The technique aims to cultivate deeper understanding and reflective capabilities, moving beyond basic forward reasoning.",
