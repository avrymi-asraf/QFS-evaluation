SUMMARY:\nThe article \"rStar-Math: Small LLMs Can Master Math Reasoning with Self-Evolved Deep Thinking\" introduces rStar-Math, a system that significantly enhances the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Small Language Models (SLMs). A core innovation is its \"code-augmented CoT data synthesis method,\" which leverages code execution as a crucial verifier for synthetic reasoning data. This method decomposes math problems into step-by-step generation within a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework. At each step, the SLM generates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning step along with corresponding Python code. Crucially, only those generated steps whose Python code executes successfully are retained. This code execution acts as a direct verifier, filtering out erroneous or nonsensical reasoning steps early in the generation process. This rigorous verification ensures that the synthesized training data consists of high-quality, executable intermediate steps, thereby improving the overall reasoning quality of the SLMs.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Code execution is used as a verifier to filter out incorrect or nonsensical intermediate reasoning steps generated by SLMs.\n*   The \"code-augmented CoT data synthesis method\" integrates Python code with natural language reasoning steps, and only code-executable steps are kept.\n*   This verification process ensures that the synthetic training data for SLMs comprises high-quality, executable reasoning trajectories.\n*   This approach allows SLMs to generate step-by-step verified reasoning trajectories, which are then used to train improved policy and reward models.",
