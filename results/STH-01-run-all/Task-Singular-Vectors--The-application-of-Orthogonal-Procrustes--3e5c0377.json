SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices to address challenges in model merging, particularly task interference and efficiency. Recognizing that task matrices are often low-rank, the authors propose TSV-Compress (TSV-C) to significantly reduce the size of task vectors (to 10%) while preserving high accuracy (99%). Crucially, they leverage the geometric properties of TSVs from different tasks to measure and mitigate interference. Their novel TSV-Merge (TSV-M) approach combines this compression with interference reduction, achieved by decorrelating TSVs using an orthogonal Procrustes transformation. This method demonstrably outperforms existing model merging techniques, achieving state-of-the-art results by effectively reducing interference through the application of Orthogonal Procrustes analysis to task-specific feature bases (singular vectors).\n\n2.
