SUMMARY:\nThis survey examines the application of multi-objective evolutionary principles within the research combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). The paper categorizes this integration into three main avenues: LLM-enhanced EA, EA-enhanced LLM, and applications driven by their synergy. Within LLM-enhanced EA, multi-objective optimization is specifically addressed in how LLMs act as search operators. For instance, in multi-objective evolutionary optimization (MOEAs), LLMs are used to generate offspring individuals for subproblems, and in Quality-Diversity (QD) search, LLMs evaluate the quality and diversity of solutions. The research also highlights how EAs can be used for multi-objective prompt engineering, aiming to optimize prompts based on multiple criteria. Furthermore, EA-based LLM architecture search often involves multi-objective optimization to balance factors like performance and latency. The paper underscores that while EAs provide a robust optimization framework, LLMs offer domain knowledge and text processing capabilities that can significantly enhance EA performance, particularly in complex, multi-objective scenarios.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Multi-objective evolutionary optimization (MOEAs) is a key area where LLMs are employed as search operators to generate offspring individuals for subproblems.\n*   LLMs are utilized in Quality-Diversity (QD) search to evaluate the quality and diversity of solutions, contributing to multi-objective optimization.\n*   Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are applied to multi-objective prompt engineering, optimizing prompts based on multiple criteria to enhance LLM performance.\n*   EA-based LLM architecture search frequently employs multi-objective optimization to balance competing goals such as model performance and latency.\n*   The integration leverages LLMs' domain knowledge and text processing for EA enhancement, particularly beneficial in complex, multi-objective optimization tasks.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper surveys the synergistic relationship between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), with a particular focus on how multi-objective evolutionary principles are applied. The research categorizes this interplay into three main avenues: LLM-enhanced EA, EA-enhanced LLM, and applications driven by their integrated synergy. In LLM-enhanced EA, LLMs act as intelligent operators or algorithm generators, leveraging their knowledge and text processing capabilities to improve EA performance, particularly in multi-objective optimization tasks where LLMs can generate new offspring individuals or evaluate solution quality and diversity. Conversely, EA-enhanced LLM utilizes EAs for tasks like prompt engineering and neural architecture search (NAS), where multi-objective EAs can optimize prompts for multiple criteria or discover NAS solutions that balance performance and efficiency. The applications section details how this synergy addresses complex tasks, including code generation, software engineering, and NAS, often employing multi-objective evolutionary strategies to navigate complex solution spaces and find optimal trade-offs.\n\n2.

It details how LLMs enhance EAs through mechanisms like providing domain knowledge to guide search, generating novel optimization operators, and assisting in algorithm design. Conversely, EAs enhance LLMs by optimizing prompts for better performance (prompt engineering) and refining LLM architectures through neural architecture search. The paper categorizes research into these two main avenues and further examines applications driven by their integrated synergy, such as code generation, software engineering, and neural architecture search. Within LLM-enhanced EAs, a significant focus is placed on LLM-assisted black-box optimization, where LLMs act as search operators. For EA-enhanced LLMs, EA-based prompt engineering and architecture search are highlighted as key areas. The survey also specifically addresses the application of multi-objective evolutionary principles in several contexts, including multi-objective optimization within LLM-assisted black-box optimization and multi-objective NAS.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs enhance EAs by providing domain knowledge and generating optimization operators, while EAs improve LLMs through prompt engineering and neural architecture search.\n*   LLM-assisted black-box optimization uses LLMs as search operators within EA frameworks to tackle optimization problems.\n*   EA-based prompt engineering leverages EAs to optimize LLM prompts for improved performance across various tasks.\n*   The integration of LLMs and EAs is shown to be effective in applications like code generation, software engineering, and neural architecture search.\n*   Multi-objective evolutionary principles are applied in areas such as multi-objective optimization with LLMs and in the search for optimal LLM architectures.",

From the perspective of LLM-enhanced EAs, LLMs are increasingly utilized as powerful black-box search operators, aiding in tasks like prompt optimization and even algorithm generation. Conversely, EAs enhance LLMs through prompt engineering, optimizing LLM behavior and outputs without direct model access. This synergy is prominently applied in diverse areas, including code generation, where LLMs provide initial code and EAs refine it, and software engineering, improving processes like test case generation and optimization. In Neural Architecture Search (NAS), EAs guide the exploration of complex architectural spaces, often leveraging LLMs for their understanding of code and design principles. Future directions highlight the need for LLM-assisted EAs to tackle complex, large-scale optimization problems and the development of more robust and stable prompt engineering techniques, ensuring reliable and efficient LLM-EA collaborations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs are being integrated into EAs as black-box search operators to enhance optimization processes, particularly in prompt optimization and algorithm generation.\n*   EAs are crucial for optimizing LLM performance through prompt engineering, enabling more effective and tailored outputs.\n*   The synergy between LLMs and EAs is driving advancements in code generation, software engineering (e.g., testing, optimization), and Neural Architecture Search (NAS).\n*   Future research aims to equip LLM-assisted EAs to handle more complex and large-scale optimization challenges and to develop more stable and robust prompt engineering methods.",

It highlights how multi-objective evolutionary principles are applied across various research areas where LLMs and EAs intersect. LLM-assisted black-box optimization leverages LLMs as search operators, with specific advancements noted in multi-objective scenarios, where LLMs generate offspring individuals for subproblems or evaluate solution quality and diversity. EA-based prompt engineering utilizes EAs to optimize prompts for LLMs, often considering multiple objectives such as performance, length, and perplexity, thereby enhancing LLM outputs. The paper categorizes research into LLM-enhanced EAs and EA-enhanced LLMs. In applications, multi-objective evolutionary principles are evident in code generation, where EAs and LLMs collaborate for universal and domain-specific code creation, and in software engineering for tasks like test case generation and project planning. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) also benefits from multi-objective optimization, where EAs guide the search for optimal LLM architectures, often balancing performance and efficiency.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Multi-objective evolutionary principles are applied in LLM-assisted black-box optimization, particularly in generating offspring individuals and evaluating solution quality/diversity for multi-objective scenarios.\n*   EA-based prompt engineering frequently employs multi-objective optimization to refine LLM prompts based on criteria like performance, length, and perplexity.\n*   In code generation and software engineering applications, multi-objective evolutionary strategies are used to improve code quality, generate diverse test cases, and optimize project planning.\n*   Neural Architecture Search (NAS) leverages multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to discover optimal LLM architectures, balancing competing goals such as performance and efficiency.\n*   The research categorizes the interplay into LLM-enhanced EA and EA-enhanced LLM, with multi-objective evolutionary concepts underpinning many of these synergistic approaches.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis survey explores the synergistic application of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). It details how multi-objective evolutionary principles are integrated across various research areas. In LLM-enhanced EA, EAs leverage LLMs as search operators for both single-objective and multi-objective black-box optimization, and for generating novel optimization algorithms. Conversely, EA-enhanced LLMs utilize EAs for prompt engineering, including discrete and gradient-free soft prompt optimization, and for Neural Architecture Search (NAS). The paper also highlights applications where LLMs and EAs work together, such as in code generation and software engineering, often involving multi-objective considerations for tasks like software optimization and project planning. The research categorizes this interplay into LLM-enhanced EA, EA-enhanced LLM, and applications driven by their integrated synergy, emphasizing the complementary strengths of both approaches.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Multi-objective evolutionary principles are applied in LLM-assisted black-box optimization, where LLMs act as search operators to generate offspring for subproblems.\n*   EA-based prompt engineering utilizes multi-objective optimization (e.g., NSGA-II) to find optimal prompts considering multiple criteria like performance and instruction length.\n*   Neural Architecture Search (NAS) often employs multi-objective EAs to balance various objectives like accuracy, latency, and model size when optimizing LLM architectures.\n*   In code generation and software engineering, EAs are combined with LLMs, sometimes incorporating multi-objective approaches for tasks like optimizing example selection for LLM learning.\n*   The research categorizes the synergy as LLM-enhanced EA (e.g., LLMs as optimization operators) and EA-enhanced LLM (e.g., EAs for prompt engineering and NAS), demonstrating complementary strengths.",

From the perspective of multi-objective evolutionary principles, the research highlights their integration in several key areas. LLM-assisted black-box optimization leverages LLMs to generate novel solutions or guide search processes, with specific attention paid to multi-objective optimization scenarios where LLMs act as search operators within decomposition-based MOEAs or Quality-Diversity frameworks. EA-based prompt engineering also incorporates multi-objective optimization, for instance, in optimizing prompts for multiple objectives like instruction length and perplexity. In Neural Architecture Search (NAS), multi-objective optimization is employed to balance metrics such as perplexity and latency. Similarly, in code generation and software engineering, multi-objective EAs are utilized to optimize code for various non-functional properties or to select optimal example sets for LLMs. Across other generative tasks, multi-objective optimization is applied to refine image generation quality by simultaneously optimizing text prompts and model hyperparameters.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs are being integrated into multi-objective evolutionary optimization as black-box search operators, aiding in generating offspring for subproblems or evaluating quality and diversity.\n*   EA-based prompt engineering leverages multi-objective optimization to find prompts that satisfy multiple criteria, such as balancing instruction length and performance.\n*   In Neural Architecture Search (NAS), multi-objective EAs are used to discover architectures that optimize performance metrics like perplexity and latency simultaneously.\n*   Multi-objective evolutionary principles are applied in code generation and software engineering to optimize for various functional and non-functional aspects, as well as in selecting optimal training data for LLMs.\n*   The synergy between LLMs and EAs is also driving multi-objective optimization in other generative tasks, such as text-to-image generation, by optimizing both prompts and model parameters.",

From the perspective of multi-objective evolutionary principles, the research highlights how LLMs can enhance EAs, particularly in black-box optimization scenarios. LLMs are employed as search operators, aiding in generating novel solutions for both single-objective and multi-objective problems, and can also assist in generating new optimization algorithms. Conversely, EAs are used to enhance LLMs, notably through prompt engineering, which is increasingly framed as a multi-objective optimization task to refine LLM outputs. In Neural Architecture Search (NAS), EAs are crucial for exploring the vast architecture space, often with multi-objective considerations for performance and efficiency. The paper also touches upon Quality-Diversity search, where LLMs evaluate solution quality and diversity. While the focus is broad, the underlying theme is the synergistic application of evolutionary principles to complex optimization and generation tasks involving LLMs, with multi-objective considerations appearing in various sub-domains like NAS and prompt engineering.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper explores the synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), with a particular focus on the application of multi-objective evolutionary principles. In LLM-assisted black-box optimization, EAs are used to enhance LLM capabilities, especially in multi-objective scenarios where LLMs act as search operators to generate new offspring individuals for subproblems. Quality-Diversity (QD) search, such as the QDAIF algorithm, leverages LLMs for evaluating solution quality and diversity, allowing EAs to maintain and update solution libraries. EA-based prompt engineering is a significant area, with methods like InstOptima employing multi-objective optimization (e.g., NSGA-II) to find Pareto fronts of effective prompts based on multiple criteria like performance and instruction length. In EA-based LLM architecture search (NAS), multi-objective EAs are used to discover architectures that balance competing objectives like perplexity and latency. The SBSE method by Tawosi et al. is highlighted for optimizing example selection in LLM-based story point estimation using NSGA-II to manage trade-offs between estimation accuracy and complexity.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Multi-objective evolutionary principles are applied in LLM-assisted black-box optimization, where LLMs serve as search operators for subproblems in multi-objective scenarios.\n*   Quality-Diversity (QD) search utilizes LLMs to evaluate solutions, with EAs managing the solution library for iterative optimization.\n*   EA-based prompt engineering, exemplified by InstOptima, uses multi-objective EAs (like NSGA-II) to optimize prompts based on multiple criteria.\n*   Multi-objective EAs are employed in LLM architecture search (NAS) to balance objectives such as perplexity and latency.\n*   The SBSE method by Tawosi et al. uses NSGA-II for multi-objective optimization of example selection for LLM-based estimation tasks.",

It categorizes this collaboration into three main avenues: LLM-enhanced EA, EA-enhanced LLM, and applications driven by their integrated synergy. In the LLM-enhanced EA paradigm, LLMs act as advanced operators, leveraging their domain knowledge and generative capabilities to improve EA search efficiency and algorithm design. Conversely, EA-enhanced LLM focuses on using EAs to optimize LLMs, particularly through prompt engineering and neural architecture search (NAS), to improve their performance and efficiency. The integrated synergy section details how these combined strengths are applied to various downstream tasks, including code generation, software engineering, and NAS. The paper highlights LLM-assisted black-box optimization and EA-based prompt engineering and architecture search as key areas within these paradigms, showcasing how LLMs can provide intelligent guidance and optimization capabilities to EAs, while EAs offer robust search mechanisms for refining LLM outputs and structures.\n\n2.
