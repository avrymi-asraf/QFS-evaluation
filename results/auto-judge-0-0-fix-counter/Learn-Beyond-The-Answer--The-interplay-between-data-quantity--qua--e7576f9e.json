      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces \"reflective augmentation\" (RefAug), a novel fine-tuning technique for language models (LMs) aimed at improving mathematical reasoning. Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the training set with more problems, RefAug enriches each training instance with a \"reflection\" component. This reflection includes alternative reasoning approaches and follow-up scenarios (abstraction or analogy), encouraging deeper understanding and flexible application of mathematical concepts. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance on standard single-round math problems, achieving an average accuracy gain of +7.2 over direct fine-tuning. Crucially, RefAug excels in complex reflective reasoning tasks, such as follow-up questions and error correction, where conventional augmentation methods falter. The paper also highlights that RefAug is complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to even greater performance improvements when combined. The effectiveness of RefAug extends to code generation, underscoring its general applicability in tasks requiring logical step-by-step processing. The method enhances reasoning accuracy primarily by reducing reasoning errors rather than calculation errors, suggesting a deeper internalization of mathematical principles.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) enhances LM math reasoning by embedding alternative and follow-up reasoning within training data, promoting deeper understanding beyond mere problem-solving.\n*   RefAug improves performance on standard math tasks by +7.2 accuracy and significantly boosts capabilities in complex reflective reasoning scenarios where other methods fall short.\n*   The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, leading to synergistic gains when combined.\n*   RefAug's effectiveness is demonstrated not only in mathematical reasoning but also in code generation, indicating its broad applicability to tasks requiring logical progression.\n*   The method primarily improves reasoning accuracy by reducing reasoning errors, suggesting a more robust grasp of mathematical concepts.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces \"Reflective Augmentation\" (RefAug), a novel technique for fine-tuning language models on mathematical tasks that goes beyond simply expanding the dataset. Instead, RefAug enriches each training instance with a \"reflection\" component, which includes alternative reasoning approaches and follow-up scenarios (abstraction or analogy). This method aims to cultivate a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and reasoning methodologies, rather than just increasing data quantity. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly improves performance on both standard single-round math problems and more complex reflective reasoning tasks (like follow-up questions and error correction), outperforming traditional data augmentation techniques. It also shows complementary benefits when combined with existing methods. The study further analyzes the impact of different reflective components, the amount of RefAug data, and the use of open-source models for data annotation, finding that higher quality annotations are crucial for advanced reflective reasoning.

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\n\nThis paper introduces \"reflective augmentation\" (RefAug), a novel technique to enhance language model (LM) performance on mathematical tasks by embedding problem reflection into training data. Unlike traditional data augmentation methods that expand the dataset size, RefAug focuses on enriching individual training instances with \"alternative reasoning\" (presenting different solution paths) and \"follow-up reasoning\" (generalizing or extending the problem). Experiments demonstrate that RefAug not only improves performance on standard single-round math problems but also significantly boosts capabilities in more complex reflective reasoning scenarios, where data expansion methods often fall short. RefAug is shown to be complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to even greater gains. An error analysis reveals that RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors, suggesting a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts. Furthermore, the method proves effective in code generation tasks, indicating its broad applicability. The quality of the reflective sections, generated by advanced LMs like GPT-4, is crucial for achieving these improvements, especially for complex reasoning.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n*   RefAug enhances LMs by adding \"alternative\" and \"follow-up\" reasoning to training data, fostering deeper understanding beyond simple answer generation.\n*   RefAug significantly improves performance on complex reflective math reasoning tasks, where traditional data expansion methods are less effective.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, leading to synergistic performance gains.\n*   The method effectively reduces reasoning errors in LMs, indicating improved logical understanding of mathematical problems.\n*   RefAug is also applicable and beneficial for code generation tasks, demonstrating its versatility.",

Unlike traditional data augmentation methods that primarily increase the quantity and diversity of training instances, RefAug focuses on enriching the quality of existing data by embedding problem reflection within each training example. This reflection involves presenting alternative reasoning paths and follow-up scenarios (abstraction or analogy) to foster a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and problem-solving methodologies. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug not only improves performance on standard single-round math QA tasks but also significantly boosts capabilities in more complex reflective reasoning scenarios, such as follow-up questions and error correction, where existing augmentation methods fall short. Furthermore, RefAug proves to be complementary to traditional data expansion techniques, leading to even greater performance gains when combined. The method's effectiveness extends to code generation tasks, and ablation studies confirm the value of both alternative and follow-up reasoning components. The research also touches upon the quality of data annotation and the minimal impact on inference efficiency.\n\n2.

Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the training set with more problems, RefAug enriches each training instance with a \"reflection\" section. This section includes alternative solution approaches and follow-up reasoning, encouraging deeper understanding and flexible application of mathematical concepts. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance on standard single-round math QA tasks, achieving a +7.2 accuracy gain. Crucially, it markedly enhances performance in more complex reflective reasoning scenarios, such as follow-up questions and error correction, where existing methods fall short. RefAug is also complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to further performance gains when combined. The study also explores RefAug's effectiveness in code generation and analyzes its components, data scaling, and efficiency, concluding that it fosters more robust mathematical reasoning by promoting deeper comprehension rather than just memorization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n*   RefAug enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by embedding alternative and follow-up reasoning into training data, leading to deeper understanding beyond simple answer generation.\n*   The technique provides significant accuracy gains (+7.2) on standard math QA tasks and markedly improves performance on complex reflective reasoning scenarios where traditional data augmentation methods falter.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation strategies, yielding synergistic performance improvements when combined.\n*   An ablation study confirms that both alternative and follow-up reasoning components contribute positively, with their combination yielding the best results.\n*   The method is effective across different model sizes and also shows promise in code generation tasks, suggesting reflection is a key factor for general problem-solving.",

Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the training set with more problems, RefAug enriches each existing training instance by appending a \"reflection\" section. This section includes alternative reasoning paths and follow-up reasoning (abstraction or analogy), encouraging deeper comprehension beyond mere answer generation. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug not only improves performance on standard single-round math problems but also significantly boosts capabilities in more complex reflective reasoning scenarios (like follow-up questions and error correction), where other augmentation methods fall short. RefAug is shown to be complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to further performance gains. The method also proves effective in code generation tasks, highlighting the general applicability of embedding reflective practices in LM training for enhanced problem-solving.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by incorporating \"reflection\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data.\n*   RefAug improves performance on both standard single-round math problems and more complex reflective reasoning tasks, unlike traditional data expansion methods.\n*   The proposed method is complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, yielding synergistic performance improvements.\n*   RefAug demonstrates effectiveness across different LM architectures and extends to code generation tasks, indicating its broad applicability.\n*   The core benefit of RefAug lies in fostering a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and methodologies, rather than just increasing data quantity.",

Unlike traditional data augmentation that increases the quantity of training data, RefAug focuses on enriching the quality and depth of understanding for each instance by embedding problem reflection. This reflection includes \"alternative reasoning\" (presenting different solution methods) and \"follow-up reasoning\" (generalizing or extending the problem). Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance in both standard single-round math QA and more complex reflective reasoning scenarios, where previous augmentation techniques fall short. RefAug is shown to be complementary to existing methods, leading to further performance gains when combined. An ablation study confirms the benefit of both reflection components. The method also proves effective in code generation tasks, suggesting its broader applicability. Error analysis indicates RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors. The quality of annotations is generally good, and the method has minimal impact on inference efficiency.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel training technique for language models (LMs) designed to enhance mathematical reasoning beyond simple answer generation. Unlike traditional data augmentation methods that expand the training set with more problems, RefAug enriches existing training instances by appending \"reflective sections.\" These sections, comprising alternative reasoning and follow-up reasoning (abstraction or analogy), encourage LMs to develop a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and problem-solving methodologies. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly improves performance on standard single-round math QA tasks, achieving a notable accuracy gain. Crucially, RefAug excels in complex reflective reasoning scenarios (like follow-up questions and error correction) where traditional augmentation methods fall short. Furthermore, RefAug proves complementary to existing techniques, yielding synergistic benefits when combined. An ablation study confirms the value of both alternative and follow-up reasoning components. The method also shows promise in code generation tasks. Error analysis indicates that RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors, suggesting a deeper conceptual grasp. The efficiency of RefAug is also deemed minimal, as reflective sections are not used during inference.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by embedding problem reflection (alternative/follow-up reasoning) into training data, leading to deeper understanding.\n*   RefAug significantly improves performance on complex reflective reasoning tasks, a weakness of traditional data expansion methods.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, providing further performance gains when combined.\n*   Both alternative and follow-up reasoning components contribute to RefAug's effectiveness, with the latter particularly aiding generalization.\n*   RefAug improves LMs' math problem-solving primarily by reducing reasoning errors, indicating enhanced conceptual understanding.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel training technique for language models (LMs) that enhances mathematical reasoning by embedding problem reflection into training instances. Unlike traditional data augmentation that increases the quantity of training data, RefAug focuses on the quality and depth of understanding per instance by adding \"reflective sections\" to existing solutions. These sections include \"alternative reasoning\" (different approaches to the same problem) and \"follow-up reasoning\" (generalizations or extensions). Experiments demonstrate that RefAug not only improves performance on standard single-round math problems but also significantly boosts capabilities in more complex reflective reasoning scenarios (like error correction and multi-turn problem-solving), where existing data expansion methods falter. RefAug also shows complementary benefits when combined with other augmentation techniques, leading to greater overall gains. The method's effectiveness extends to code generation, and analysis indicates it primarily reduces reasoning errors rather than calculation errors, underscoring its role in fostering deeper comprehension.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by incorporating \"reflective sections\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data, promoting deeper problem understanding beyond mere answer generation.\n*   RefAug significantly improves performance on complex \"reflective reasoning\" tasks (e.g., error correction, multi-turn problem-solving), where traditional data augmentation methods are less effective.\n*   RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to synergistic performance gains.\n*   The method effectively reduces reasoning errors, indicating it fosters a more robust understanding of mathematical concepts and methodologies.\n*   RefAug's efficacy extends to code generation tasks, demonstrating its general applicability in improving step-by-step reasoning.",
