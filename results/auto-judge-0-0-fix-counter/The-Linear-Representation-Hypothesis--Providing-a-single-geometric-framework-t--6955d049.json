SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis\" by proposing a geometric framework that connects the subspace hypothesis (e.g., word2vec analogies) with practical techniques like linear probing and activation steering. It introduces two formal definitions of linear representation: one in the output (unembedding) space, linked to measurement (linear probing), and another in the input (embedding) space, linked to intervention (activation steering). The core of the framework is the \"causal inner product,\" a novel inner product that respects the causal separability of concepts (i.e., concepts that can vary independently are orthogonal). This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for the construction of probes and steering vectors using counterfactual pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of these linear representations, the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic structure, and how these representations enable both interpretation (via probing) and control (via steering) of LLM behavior.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis\" by defining linear representations in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces.\n*   A novel \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which treats causally separable concepts as orthogonal directions, unifying embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   The formalizations connect the subspace notion of linear representation to measurement (linear probing) via unembedding representations and to intervention (activation steering) via embedding representations.\n*   Empirical results with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and demonstrate that the causal inner product effectively captures semantic structure and enables model interpretation and control.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" which posits that high-level concepts are represented as linear directions in a model's representation space. It addresses the ambiguity in defining \"linear representation\" by offering two formalizations: one in the output (unembedding) space, connecting to measurement via linear probing, and another in the input (embedding) space, linking to intervention via activation steering. The core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which is defined such that causally separable concepts are represented orthogonally. This specific inner product is shown to unify the embedding and unembedding representations. The paper further proposes an explicit form for this causal inner product, derived from assumptions about uncorrelatedness of concept representations in the unembedding space. Empirically, using LLaMA-2, the study validates that concepts are indeed represented as directions in the unembedding space, that the estimated causal inner product respects causal separability (demonstrated by orthogonality between causally independent concepts), and that these concept directions function as effective linear probes for measurement and can be used to steer model behavior.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper unifies three interpretations of linear representation (subspace, measurement, intervention) under a single geometric framework.\n*   A novel \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which formalizes the idea that causally separable concepts should be orthogonal in the representation space.\n*   This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations of concepts, allowing for a consistent geometric understanding.\n*   Empirical results with LLaMA-2 demonstrate that concept directions act as linear probes (measurement) and can be used for activation steering (intervention), validating the proposed framework.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper provides a formal geometric framework for the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" which posits that high-level concepts are linearly represented as directions in a model's representation space. The authors formalize this by defining \"unembedding representations\" (linked to measurement) and \"embedding representations\" (linked to intervention) using counterfactual word pairs. A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which mandates that causally separable concepts are orthogonal. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, enabling the use of geometric notions like projection and similarity in a semantically meaningful way. The paper demonstrates that this inner product can be estimated from model parameters and that it successfully connects the subspace hypothesis (e.g., word2vec analogies) with practical techniques like linear probing (measurement) and activation steering (intervention). Empirical validation with LLaMA-2 confirms the existence of linear representations, the utility of the causal inner product, and the connections between these different notions.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis\" by defining unembedding (measurement) and embedding (intervention) representations using counterfactual pairs.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, requiring orthogonal representations for causally separable concepts, which unifies embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   This causal inner product allows for a principled geometric framework connecting subspace analogies (like word2vec) with linear probing and activation steering techniques.\n*   Empirical results with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear representations and demonstrate that the causal inner product respects semantic structure and enables model control.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper provides a formal geometric framework to connect the \"linear representation hypothesis\" with practical interpretation and control techniques in Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors formalize \"linear representation\" in two ways: as a subspace in the output (unembedding) space, linking to measurement (probing), and as a subspace in the input (embedding) space, linking to intervention (steering). A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which is defined by the property that causally separable concepts are orthogonal. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, effectively making them equivalent. The paper demonstrates that while the inner product is not uniquely identified by the model's training objective (unidentifiability), the causal inner product can be estimated. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear representations, show that the estimated causal inner product respects semantic structure by exhibiting orthogonality between causally separable concepts, and confirm that these concept directions can be used for both probing and steering.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes \"linear representation\" of concepts as subspaces in both the input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces, linking them to model steering and probing, respectively.\n*   A novel \"causal inner product\" is introduced, defined by orthogonality between representations of causally separable concepts, which unifies embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   The study addresses the unidentifiability of the inner product by proposing an estimable causal inner product based on vocabulary sampling and demonstrating its effectiveness in experiments with LLaMA-2.\n*   Empirical results validate that concept directions derived from this framework act as effective linear probes for measurement and as vectors for model steering, confirming the hypothesis.",

It proposes a single geometric framework to connect the subspace hypothesis (like word2vec analogies) with practical techniques like linear probing and activation steering. The authors introduce two formalizations of linear representation: unembedding representations in the output space, linked to measurement (linear probing), and embedding representations in the input space, linked to intervention (activation steering). They then define a \"causal inner product\" that respects semantic separability (causally separable concepts are orthogonal). This inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for the construction of intervention vectors from unembedding representations. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear representations, the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic structure and enabling control, and demonstrate that concept directions derived from unembedding spaces can be used for both prediction and manipulation of LM behavior.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formally defines linear representations in both LM output (unembedding) and input (embedding) spaces, connecting them to linear probing (measurement) and activation steering (intervention), respectively.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which ensures that causally separable concepts are represented orthogonally, unifying embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   This unified geometric framework allows for the construction of intervention vectors from unembedding representations, bridging theoretical notions with practical control.\n*   Empirical results with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of linear concept representations and validate that the causal inner product captures semantic relationships and enables effective model steering.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" which posits that high-level concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) are represented linearly within the model's representation space. It proposes a single geometric framework that connects the subspace hypothesis (e.g., word2vec analogies) with practical techniques like linear probing and activation steering. The authors introduce two formal definitions of linear representation: \"unembedding representations\" (Definition 2.1) in the output space and \"embedding representations\" (Definition 2.3) in the input space. They demonstrate that unembedding representations correspond to measurement capabilities (Theorem 2.2), while embedding representations relate to intervention capabilities (Theorem 2.5). A crucial contribution is the concept of a \"causal inner product\" (Definition 3.1), which is defined such that causally separable concepts are orthogonal. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations (Theorem 3.2), providing a geometric bridge between the different notions. The paper highlights that the standard Euclidean inner product is generally not sufficient, as the representation space is subject to unidentifiability issues due to affine transformations that preserve model output probabilities.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes \"linear representation\" in LLMs via counterfactual pairs, defining both unembedding (output space) and embedding (input space) representations.\n*   Unembedding representations are linked to the ability to \"measure\" concepts (linear probing), while embedding representations are linked to \"intervening\" on concepts (activation steering).\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, where causally separable concepts are orthogonal, unifying the embedding and unembedding representations under a single geometric framework.\n*   The choice of inner product is critical due to the unidentifiability of the representation space under affine transformations that preserve model outputs.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" which posits that high-level concepts are represented as linear directions within a model's representation space. It proposes a geometric framework connecting the widely observed subspace hypothesis (e.g., word2vec analogies) with practical interpretability techniques like linear probing and activation steering. The authors define two formalizations of linear representation: \"unembedding representations\" in the output space, which connect to linear probing (measurement), and \"embedding representations\" in the input space, which link to activation steering (intervention). A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product\" designed to make causally separable concepts orthogonal. This specific inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, providing a single geometric lens. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these formalisms, demonstrating the existence of linear concept representations, the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic structure and causal separability, and how these representations can be used for both probing and steering model behavior.\n\n2.
