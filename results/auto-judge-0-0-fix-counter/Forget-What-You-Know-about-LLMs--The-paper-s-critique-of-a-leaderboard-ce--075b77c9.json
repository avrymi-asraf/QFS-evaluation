SUMMARY:\nThis paper critiques the current evaluation culture in NLP, particularly the heavy reliance on leaderboards which can lead to an overemphasis on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. The authors introduce the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to systematically detect this overfitting. C-BOD works by distorting benchmark prompts (like those in MMLU) through rephrasing, while preserving their semantic content. By evaluating LLMs on both original and perturbed prompts and analyzing performance differences with statistical tests, C-BOD can reveal a model's dependency on memorized patterns. Their experiments on 26 leading LLMs showed an average performance degradation of 2.15% on perturbed prompts, with 20 models exhibiting statistically significant drops. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy tended to be more sensitive to these rephrasings, suggesting they are more prone to overfitting. The paper advocates for moving beyond leaderboard scores to prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Current LLM evaluation often over-relies on public benchmarks, leading to models excelling due to dataset-specific surface cues rather than genuine understanding.\n*   The Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD) framework systematically distorts prompts to expose LLMs that overfit to specific phrasing.\n*   Experiments showed a significant performance drop (average 2.15%) in most LLMs when prompts were rephrased, indicating widespread overfitting.\n*   Larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy were found to be more susceptible to performance degradation under prompt perturbations.\n*   The paper calls for a shift in LLM evaluation to prioritize resilience and generalization over leaderboard performance.",
