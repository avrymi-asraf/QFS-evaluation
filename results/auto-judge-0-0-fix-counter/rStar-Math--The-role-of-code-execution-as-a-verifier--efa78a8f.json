SUMMARY:\nThe article \"rStar-Math: Small LLMs Can Master Math Reasoning with Self-Evolved Deep Thinking\" introduces a novel approach to enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of small language models (SLMs) by leveraging code execution as a verifier for synthetic reasoning data. The core innovation lies in a \"code-augmented Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data synthesis method\" that integrates Python code execution directly into the reasoning process. During Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts, each generated reasoning step includes corresponding Python code. This code is then executed to verify the correctness of the intermediate step. Only steps with successful code execution are retained, effectively filtering out erroneous or hallucinated reasoning. This code-based verification ensures that the synthetic data used for training the policy SLM consists of high-quality, executable reasoning trajectories, thereby establishing code execution as a robust verifier for synthetic math reasoning data. This method allows SLMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance, even surpassing larger models on complex benchmarks.\n\n2.
