SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to detect overfitting in Large Language Models (LLMs) by systematically distorting benchmark prompts. The methodology involves using a generative model to rephrase prompts while preserving their semantic content and labels. This creates a perturbed dataset which is then used alongside the original dataset to evaluate LLMs. By comparing performance on both datasets, C-BOD quantifies how much an LLM's performance degrades due to textual variations, indicating reliance on surface-level cues rather than true understanding. The framework utilizes a parametric distortion operator (µ) to control the extent of rephrasing and employs McNemar's test for statistical validation of performance differences. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 leading LLMs revealed significant performance drops (average 2.15%) under modest perturbations, with larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy showing greater sensitivity, suggesting they overfit to fixed prompt patterns. The study emphasizes the need to move beyond simple leaderboard scores and prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD uses generative models to create semantically equivalent but textually distorted prompts to evaluate LLM overfitting.\n*   The framework quantifies performance degradation on rephrased prompts, indicating reliance on surface-level cues rather than true understanding.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more sensitive to these textual perturbations, suggesting greater overfitting.\n*   The methodology is dataset-agnostic and can be integrated into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding.\n*   Findings challenge the community to prioritize LLM resilience and generalization over raw benchmark scores.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify if Large Language Models (LLMs) overfit to specific surface-level patterns in benchmark datasets. The methodology involves systematically distorting benchmark prompts via a parametric rephrasing transformation (controlled by a parameter µ) while preserving semantic content and labels. By evaluating LLMs on both original and perturbed datasets and using McNemar's test for statistical significance, C-BOD exposes vulnerabilities. The results demonstrate that a significant portion of leading LLMs exhibit performance degradation under these perturbations, indicating a reliance on memorized patterns rather than true language understanding. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more sensitive to these rephrasings. The framework is dataset-agnostic and can be integrated into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding, challenging the community to prioritize resilience over leaderboard scores.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to uncover overfitting in Large Language Models (LLMs) by systematically distorting benchmark prompts. The core methodology involves a parametric transformation (Tµ) that rephrases input questions while preserving their semantic content and correct answers. This creates a perturbed dataset (Dµ) which is then used alongside the original dataset (D) to evaluate LLMs. Performance differences between the original and perturbed datasets are analyzed using McNemar's test to determine statistical significance, revealing whether high benchmark scores are due to genuine understanding or reliance on superficial cues. The framework was applied to the MMLU benchmark using 26 leading LLMs. Results showed an average performance degradation of 2.15% on rephrased prompts, with 20 out of 26 models exhibiting statistically significant drops. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy showed greater sensitivity to perturbations, indicating a tendency to overfit to prompt patterns. The research suggests that LLMs overfit due to memorizing specific question formats or keywords rather than grasping underlying concepts.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts via parametric rephrasing to detect LLM overfitting.\n*   Evaluations on MMLU revealed an average performance degradation of 2.15% for LLMs on perturbed prompts, indicating overfitting to surface cues.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy demonstrated greater performance drops, suggesting a correlation between model scale/performance and susceptibility to overfitting.\n*   The study suggests LLMs overfit by memorizing specific prompt patterns and keywords rather than achieving true language understanding.",

SUMMARY:\nThe article introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify if Large Language Models (LLMs) overfit to specific benchmark datasets by relying on surface-level cues rather than true language understanding. C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts through parametric rephrasing while preserving semantic content. By evaluating LLMs on both original and perturbed prompts and using statistical tests like McNemar's test, C-BOD quantifies performance degradation, indicating overfitting. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs revealed an average performance drop of 2.15% under modest perturbations, with 20 models showing statistically significant differences. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy tended to exhibit greater performance declines, suggesting a reliance on fixed prompt patterns. Conversely, models like Llama and those with lower baseline accuracy showed less degradation, indicating reduced dependency on superficial cues. The framework's dataset-agnostic nature allows for integration into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding. The authors also highlight the importance of moving beyond leaderboard scores to prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   **C-BOD Methodology:** C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts using parametric rephrasing to detect LLM overfitting, evaluating performance on original versus perturbed versions.\n*   **Overfitting Detection and Significance:** The framework uses McNemar's test to determine if performance differences between original and perturbed prompts are statistically significant, indicating genuine overfitting rather than random variation.\n*   **Model Size vs. Overfitting:** Larger LLMs generally show a greater performance degradation when prompts are perturbed, suggesting they are more sensitive to surface-level patterns.\n*   **Accuracy vs. Overfitting:** Models with higher baseline accuracy on original benchmarks tend to experience larger performance drops under prompt perturbations, indicating a potential reliance on benchmark-specific cues.\n*   **Reproducibility and Code Release:** The C-BOD framework, along with rephrased datasets and code, is publicly available to enable independent replication and adoption by the research community.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify overfitting in Large Language Models (LLMs) by systematically distorting benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic content and labels. The methodology involves generating a perturbed dataset using a rephrasing tool parameterized by a distortion level (µ). LLMs are then evaluated on both the original and perturbed datasets. Performance differences are quantified, and McNemar's test is used to determine the statistical significance of these differences, indicating overfitting to surface-level cues. The research reveals that most LLMs exhibit performance degradation under these perturbations, with larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy being more susceptible. This suggests that high scores on public benchmarks may not always reflect true language understanding but rather an overreliance on specific prompt patterns. The framework is dataset-agnostic and can be integrated into training pipelines to promote more robust LLMs.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts to detect LLM overfitting to surface-level cues, preserving semantic meaning and labels.\n*   The method uses McNemar's test to statistically validate performance differences between original and perturbed datasets, revealing that most tested LLMs show significant degradation.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher initial accuracy tend to exhibit greater performance drops when prompts are rephrased, indicating a stronger reliance on prompt patterns.\n*   The framework is dataset-agnostic and can be used to promote more resilient LLMs by identifying vulnerabilities to prompt variations.\n*   Limitations include a focus on textual rephrasing, potentially missing deeper overfitting types, and increased computational costs for iterative mitigation strategies.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to detect overfitting in Large Language Models (LLMs) by systematically distorting benchmark prompts. The core methodology involves using a rephrasing transformation, parameterized by a distortion level (µ), to generate perturbed versions of evaluation datasets while preserving semantic content. LLMs are then evaluated on both original and perturbed datasets, and a statistical test (McNemar's test) is used to determine if performance differences are statistically significant, indicating reliance on surface-level cues. The study found that a significant number of LLMs, particularly larger ones and those with high baseline accuracy, exhibit performance degradation under these perturbations, suggesting overfitting to canonical prompt formats. The framework is dataset-agnostic and can be integrated into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding. While effective at detecting surface-level overfitting, limitations include potential oversight of deeper forms of overfitting and increased computational costs for mitigation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts using a parametric rephrasing transformation (µ) to reveal LLM overfitting to surface cues.\n*   The methodology evaluates LLMs on original and perturbed datasets and uses McNemar's test to statistically validate performance differences.\n*   Results show that many LLMs, especially larger and higher-accuracy models, exhibit performance degradation when prompts are rephrased, indicating overfitting.\n*   The framework is dataset-agnostic and can be used to promote more robust LLM generalization.\n*   Limitations include potential overlooking of deeper overfitting and increased computational cost for mitigation.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to detect overfitting in Large Language Models (LLMs) to benchmark-specific surface cues. The methodology involves systematically distorting benchmark prompts using a parametric rephrasing tool (Tµ) to create perturbed datasets while preserving semantic content and labels. LLMs are then evaluated on both original and perturbed datasets, and McNemar's test is used to statistically assess performance differences. The experimental setup utilized the MMLU benchmark and 26 leading LLMs, revealing that most models exhibit a performance degradation (average 2.15%) under these modest perturbations, indicating a reliance on memorized patterns rather than true understanding. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy showed greater sensitivity to rephrasing. The paper posits that overfitting stems from LLMs associating specific question formats or keywords with answers, leading to failures when these cues are altered. Limitations include the focus on textual rephrasing and potential computational costs for iterative mitigation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts via parametric rephrasing (Tµ) to detect LLM overfitting to surface cues, preserving semantic content and labels.\n*   McNemar's test is used to statistically validate performance differences between original and perturbed datasets, with 20 out of 26 LLMs showing significant degradation.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher initial accuracy tend to be more sensitive to rephrasing, indicating a greater reliance on prompt-specific patterns.\n*   Overfitting is attributed to LLMs memorizing specific question formats or keywords rather than generalizing concepts, leading to performance drops when phrasing changes.\n*   The framework is dataset-agnostic and can be integrated into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding, though it may overlook deeper forms of overfitting.",

SUMMARY:\nThe article introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify when Large Language Models (LLMs) overfit to specific benchmark datasets by relying on surface-level cues rather than true language understanding. The core methodology involves systematically distorting benchmark prompts using a parametric rephrasing tool, controlled by a distortion parameter µ, to create perturbed datasets. LLMs are then evaluated on both the original and perturbed datasets, and their performance differences are analyzed using statistical tests like McNemar's test to detect significant drops. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 leading LLMs revealed that, on average, models experienced a 2.15% performance degradation under modest perturbations, with 20 out of 26 models showing statistically significant differences. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy tended to be more sensitive to these rephrasings, suggesting a greater reliance on fixed prompt patterns. The C-BOD framework is dataset- and model-agnostic, allowing for integration into training pipelines to foster more robust language understanding and challenging the community to prioritize resilience over leaderboard scores.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts using a parametric rephrasing tool (µ) to generate adversarial evaluation datasets.\n*   The framework evaluates LLMs on both original and perturbed datasets to detect performance degradation indicative of overfitting to surface cues.\n*   Experiments showed an average 2.15% accuracy drop across 26 LLMs on rephrased MMLU prompts, with most models exhibiting statistically significant performance declines.\n*   Larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy were found to be more susceptible to performance drops under prompt perturbations.\n*   The methodology is dataset- and model-agnostic, aiming to promote more robust LLM evaluation beyond simple benchmark scores.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to detect overfitting in Large Language Models (LLMs) by systematically distorting benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic content. The methodology involves generating perturbed datasets using a parametric rephrasing transformation (controlled by parameter µ) and evaluating LLMs on both original and perturbed datasets. Performance differences, particularly a decline on perturbed data, are analyzed using McNemar's test to determine statistical significance, indicating reliance on surface-level cues rather than true language understanding. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs revealed an average performance degradation of 2.15%, with larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy exhibiting greater sensitivity to these rephrasings. The study found that LLMs overfit due to memorized patterns, specific terminologies, and subtle phrasing changes. While C-BOD is dataset-agnostic, its limitations include potential oversight of deeper overfitting forms and increased computational costs for iterative mitigation. The framework aims to encourage more robust LLM evaluation beyond leaderboard scores.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   **C-BOD Methodology:** C-BOD detects LLM overfitting by comparing performance on original benchmark prompts versus semantically equivalent but textually distorted prompts, using a parametric transformation (µ) and statistical significance testing.\n*   **LLM Overfitting Causes:** LLMs overfit to benchmarks by relying on memorized patterns, specific terminologies, and surface-level cues rather than true semantic understanding.\n*   **Model Size vs. Performance Drop:** Larger LLMs tend to show a greater performance degradation when subjected to prompt perturbations, indicating a potential over-reliance on fixed prompt patterns.\n*   **Accuracy vs. Performance Drop:** Models with higher baseline accuracy on original benchmarks are more likely to experience significant performance drops when prompts are rephrased, suggesting their high scores may stem from dataset-specific memorization.\n*   **Limitations of C-BOD:** C-BOD may not detect all forms of overfitting (e.g., factual inaccuracies) and integrating its mitigation strategies can be computationally expensive.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify overfitting in Large Language Models (LLMs) by systematically distorting benchmark prompts. The core methodology involves using a generative model (specifically DeepSeek 3) to rephrase benchmark questions while preserving their semantic content and correct answers. This creates a perturbed dataset (Dµ) which is then used alongside the original dataset (D) to evaluate LLMs. By comparing performance on both datasets and using McNemar's test for statistical significance, C-BOD quantifies the LLM's reliance on surface-level cues rather than true language understanding. The study found that many LLMs, particularly larger ones, exhibit significant performance degradation when faced with these rephrased prompts, indicating overfitting to canonical prompt structures. This generative approach to creating adversarial evaluation datasets is presented as a crucial step towards developing more robust and generalizable LLMs, moving beyond superficial benchmark scores.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD uses a generative model to create semantically equivalent but textually distorted versions of benchmark prompts to detect LLM overfitting.\n*   The framework evaluates LLMs on both original and perturbed datasets, using statistical tests (McNemar's) to determine if performance differences are significant.\n*   Results show that many LLMs, especially larger ones, experience performance drops on rephrased prompts, indicating reliance on surface-level cues.\n*   The methodology is dataset-agnostic and can be integrated into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding.\n*   High baseline accuracy in LLMs correlates with greater performance degradation under perturbation, suggesting these models may overfit fixed prompt patterns.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify overfitting in Large Language Models (LLMs) by systematically distorting benchmark prompts. The core methodology involves using a generative model (specifically DeepSeek 3) to rephrase benchmark questions while preserving their semantic content and correct answers. This creates a perturbed dataset (Dµ) which is then used alongside the original dataset (D) to evaluate LLMs. By comparing performance on both datasets and using McNemar's test for statistical significance, C-BOD quantifies the LLM's reliance on surface-level cues rather than true language understanding. The study found that many LLMs, particularly larger ones, exhibit significant performance degradation when faced with these rephrased prompts, indicating overfitting to canonical prompt structures. This generative approach to creating adversarial evaluation datasets is presented as a crucial step towards developing more robust and generalizable LLMs, moving beyond superficial benchmark scores.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD uses a generative model to create semantically equivalent but textually distorted versions of benchmark prompts to detect LLM overfitting.\n*   The framework evaluates LLMs on both original and perturbed datasets, using statistical tests (McNemar's) to determine if performance differences are significant.\n*   Results show that many LLMs, especially larger ones, experience performance drops on rephrased prompts, indicating reliance on surface-level cues.\n*   The methodology is dataset-agnostic and can be integrated into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding.\n*   High baseline accuracy in LLMs correlates with greater performance degradation under perturbation, suggesting these models may overfit fixed prompt patterns.",
