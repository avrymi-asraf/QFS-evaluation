SUMMARY:\nThis paper explores the synergistic relationship between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), positioning Neural Architecture Search (NAS) as a key area where this synergy is applied. LLMs can enhance EAs by providing domain knowledge and improving search operators, while EAs can optimize LLM components like prompts and architectures. Specifically for NAS, LLMs can represent architectural knowledge, generate code for architectures, and act as performance predictors, guiding EA-driven search. Conversely, EAs provide a robust framework for exploring the vast space of neural architectures, automating a process that is otherwise manual and time-consuming. The paper details how EAs can be used to discover novel LLM backbones, optimize layer dimensions, and tune hyperparameters, leading to more efficient and specialized models. This integration allows for a more intelligent and automated NAS process, leveraging the strengths of both technologies.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a significant application area benefiting from the synergy between LLMs and EAs.\n*   LLMs can contribute to NAS by encoding architectural knowledge, generating architecture code, and predicting performance, while EAs provide the search framework.\n*   EAs are used to automate the discovery of LLM architectures, including novel backbones, layer dimensions, and hyperparameters, leading to improved efficiency and specialization.\n*   This collaboration allows for a more intelligent and automated NAS process, optimizing the design of neural networks.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper surveys the synergistic relationship between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), framing both as optimization targets and domains for synergy. LLMs can enhance EAs by providing domain knowledge for more intelligent search and by aiding in tasks like prompt and algorithm generation. Conversely, EAs can optimize LLMs, particularly in black-box settings like prompt engineering and Neural Architecture Search (NAS). The paper details how EAs serve as a powerful search framework for NAS, while LLMs contribute through their representational and code generation capabilities. LLM-based NAS methods leverage LLMs to guide the search for optimal neural architectures. However, challenges remain in LLM+EA NAS, including the time-consuming nature of the search and the generalization ability of LLM-based approaches, necessitating further research into fine-tuning and specialized pre-training.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs can enhance EAs by providing domain knowledge and generating novel algorithms, while EAs can optimize LLMs, especially in black-box scenarios like NAS.\n*   EAs provide a robust search framework for Neural Architecture Search (NAS), enabling the exploration of complex architectural spaces.\n*   LLMs contribute to NAS by encoding architectures, generating code for network structures, and acting as performance predictors, guiding EA-driven searches.\n*   Key challenges in LLM+EA NAS include the high computational cost of evaluating architectures and the limited generalization capabilities of current LLM-based NAS methods.\n*   Future research directions for LLM+EA NAS involve improving LLM fine-tuning, specialized pre-training, and developing more efficient search strategies to address these challenges.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper explores the synergistic relationship between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), positioning both as targets for optimization and domains for mutual enhancement. The research is categorized into three main avenues: LLM-enhanced EA, EA-enhanced LLM, and applications driven by their integrated synergy. LLMs can bolster EAs by providing domain knowledge and improving search operators, while EAs can optimize LLMs through techniques like prompt engineering and neural architecture search (NAS). Specifically, LLM-assisted black-box optimization leverages LLMs to generate solutions, and EA-based prompt engineering uses EAs to discover effective prompts. Similarly, EA-based LLM architecture search employs EAs to discover optimal LLM configurations. The synergy is further demonstrated in applications like code generation, software engineering, and NAS, where the combined strengths address complex challenges and drive innovation. The roadmap suggests future research on more robust prompt engineering, theoretical analysis, and generalized applications across various domains.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs can enhance EAs by providing domain knowledge and improving search operators, while EAs can optimize LLMs through prompt engineering and Neural Architecture Search (NAS).\n*   LLM-assisted black-box optimization uses LLMs for solution generation, and EA-based prompt engineering utilizes EAs to discover effective prompts for LLMs.\n*   EA-based LLM architecture search employs EAs to optimize LLM configurations, and the integrated synergy of LLMs and EAs is applied to domains like code generation and software engineering.\n*   Future research directions include developing more robust prompt engineering techniques, conducting theoretical analysis of LLM+EA methods, and exploring generalized applications in complex tasks.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper explores the synergistic relationship between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), viewing them as both optimization targets and domains for synergy. LLMs enhance EAs by providing domain knowledge and text processing capabilities, enabling more intelligent and flexible searches.

Key applications where this synergy is evident include Neural Architecture Search (NAS), code generation, and software engineering. The roadmap highlights future directions, emphasizing LLM-assisted optimization for complex problems, developing more intelligent EAs powered by LLMs, robust prompt engineering, and theoretical analysis of these combined methods. The research aims to unlock the full potential of this collaboration for advancing both optimization and artificial intelligence.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs can serve as optimization targets for EAs, particularly for improving prompts and neural architectures (EA-enhanced LLM).\n*   EAs can enhance LLMs by providing sophisticated search capabilities and domain knowledge, aiding in optimization tasks (LLM-enhanced EA).\n*   The synergy between LLMs and EAs is crucial for advancements in areas like Neural Architecture Search (NAS), code generation, and software engineering.\n*   Future research should focus on leveraging LLMs for complex, large-scale optimization problems and developing more intelligent, automatous EAs powered by LLM capabilities.\n*   Robust prompt engineering and theoretical analysis of LLM-EA interactions are identified as key areas for future development.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper explores the synergistic relationship between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), positioning both as targets for optimization and domains for mutual enhancement. The research categorizes this interplay into three main avenues: LLM-enhanced EA, EA-enhanced LLM, and applications driven by their integrated synergy. LLM-enhanced EA leverages LLMs' knowledge and generative capabilities to improve EA search operators, algorithm generation, and overall intelligence. Conversely, EA-enhanced LLM utilizes EAs for sophisticated prompt engineering and neural architecture search (NAS), optimizing LLM performance and efficiency. The paper also details applications where this synergy is crucial, including code generation, software engineering, and NAS, highlighting how EAs provide a robust search framework while LLMs offer domain knowledge and advanced generative abilities. Future directions emphasize tackling complex optimization with LLM-assisted EAs, improving prompt engineering robustness, and conducting theoretical studies for LLM+EA methods to unlock their full potential.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs can enhance EAs by acting as intelligent search operators, improving algorithm generation, and providing domain knowledge.\n*   EAs can enhance LLMs through advanced prompt engineering and optimizing their neural architectures (NAS).\n*   The synergy between LLMs and EAs is crucial for applications like code generation, software engineering, and NAS, where EAs provide search and LLMs provide intelligence.\n*   Future research directions include using LLMs to tackle complex/large-scale optimization problems and developing robust, theoretically grounded LLM+EA methods.\n*   Prompt engineering for LLMs can be significantly improved by EAs, leading to more stable and effective solutions.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper explores the symbiotic relationship between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), positioning NAS as a key area where this synergy is applied. EAs can optimize LLMs by serving as a black-box optimization framework for tasks like prompt engineering and Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Conversely, LLMs can enhance EAs by providing domain knowledge to guide searches, improving text-based EA applications, and even generating novel optimization algorithms. The paper categorizes this interplay into LLM-enhanced EA and EA-enhanced LLM. Specifically, LLM-assisted black-box optimization leverages LLMs to generate solutions or guide EA operators, while EA-based prompt engineering uses EAs to discover optimal prompts for LLMs. Similarly, EA-based LLM architecture search employs EAs to discover efficient LLM designs. The research highlights NAS as a prime application where LLMs' representation and generation capabilities, guided by EAs, lead to more effective architecture discovery. Future directions emphasize tackling complex optimization with LLMs, developing robust prompt engineering, and advancing theoretical understanding of these combined methods.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a significant application domain where LLMs and EAs demonstrate synergistic benefits, with EAs optimizing architectures and LLMs providing guidance.\n*   EAs can enhance LLMs through techniques like EA-based prompt engineering and EA-based LLM architecture search, optimizing LLM performance and design.\n*   LLMs can improve EAs by acting as intelligent search operators (LLM-assisted black-box optimization) or by generating optimization algorithms, thereby enhancing EA efficiency and capabilities.\n*   The paper categorizes the research into \"LLM-enhanced EA\" and \"EA-enhanced LLM,\" with applications driven by their integrated synergy being a crucial outcome.\n*   Future research aims to leverage LLMs for more complex optimization problems, improve the robustness and stability of prompt engineering, and deepen the theoretical understanding of LLM-EA collaborations.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper surveys the synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), positioning them as both optimization targets and domains for collaboration. The research is categorized into LLM-enhanced EA and EA-enhanced LLM. LLM-enhanced EA utilizes LLMs as powerful tools to improve EA performance, particularly in black-box optimization and algorithm generation. LLMs can serve as intelligent operators, guide search processes with their domain knowledge, and even generate novel optimization algorithms. Conversely, EA-enhanced LLM leverages EAs to optimize LLMs themselves, focusing on areas like prompt engineering and neural architecture search (NAS). EAs are adept at navigating the complex search spaces involved in finding optimal prompts or architectures, overcoming LLM limitations like inflexible searching. The paper details applications where this synergy is transformative, including code generation and NAS, showcasing how LLMs' generative and reasoning capabilities, combined with EA's iterative search, lead to more efficient and effective solutions.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs can enhance EAs by acting as intelligent search operators, providing domain knowledge, and generating optimization algorithms.\n*   EAs can enhance LLMs by optimizing prompts (prompt engineering) and discovering efficient neural network architectures (NAS).\n*   In black-box optimization, LLMs can generate solutions and guide search, while EAs provide a framework for iterative improvement.\n*   The synergy is crucial for tasks like code generation, where LLMs understand programming concepts and EAs refine the code through evolutionary processes.\n*   NAS benefits from EAs' search capabilities and LLMs' representation and generation of architectural components, leading to optimized model designs.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper surveys the symbiotic relationship between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), positioning both as targets for optimization and domains for synergy. The research is categorized into three main paradigms: LLM-enhanced EA, EA-enhanced LLM, and applications driven by their integrated synergy. LLMs can augment EAs by acting as search operators for black-box optimization, generating novel solutions, or even creating new optimization algorithms. Conversely, EAs can enhance LLMs through prompt engineering, optimizing LLM architectures (Neural Architecture Search - NAS), and improving their overall performance and capabilities. The paper details how LLMs assist in black-box optimization by understanding problem descriptions and generating solutions, while EAs provide iterative improvement. EA-based prompt engineering leverages EAs to discover optimal prompts for LLMs, and EA-based NAS automates the design of efficient LLM architectures. The roadmap section outlines future directions, emphasizing the need for LLM-assisted EAs for complex problems, more robust prompt engineering, and generalized NAS.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs can enhance EAs by serving as intelligent search operators and algorithm generators, leveraging their domain knowledge and generative capabilities.\n*   EAs can improve LLMs through techniques like prompt engineering and Neural Architecture Search (NAS), optimizing their performance and structure.\n*   The synergy between LLMs and EAs is applied across various domains, including code generation, software engineering, and NAS, demonstrating complementary strengths.\n*   Future research directions include developing LLM-assisted EAs for complex optimization and advancing robust prompt engineering and generalized NAS methods.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper surveys the symbiotic relationship between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), positioning both as targets for optimization and domains for synergy. The research is categorized into three main paradigms: LLM-enhanced EA, EA-enhanced LLM, and applications driven by their integrated synergy. LLMs can augment EAs by acting as search operators for black-box optimization, generating novel solutions, or even creating new optimization algorithms. Conversely, EAs can enhance LLMs through prompt engineering, optimizing LLM architectures (Neural Architecture Search - NAS), and improving their overall performance and capabilities. The paper details how LLMs assist in black-box optimization by understanding problem descriptions and generating solutions, while EAs provide iterative improvement. EA-based prompt engineering leverages EAs to discover optimal prompts for LLMs, and EA-based NAS automates the design of efficient LLM architectures. The roadmap section outlines future directions, emphasizing the need for LLM-assisted EAs for complex problems, more robust prompt engineering, and generalized NAS.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs can enhance EAs by serving as intelligent search operators and algorithm generators, leveraging their domain knowledge and generative capabilities.\n*   EAs can improve LLMs through techniques like prompt engineering and Neural Architecture Search (NAS), optimizing their performance and structure.\n*   The synergy between LLMs and EAs is applied across various domains, including code generation, software engineering, and NAS, demonstrating complementary strengths.\n*   Future research directions include developing LLM-assisted EAs for complex optimization and advancing robust prompt engineering and generalized NAS methods.",
