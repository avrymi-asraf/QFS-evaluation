The core of this approach involves progressively transferring knowledge from multiple large, state-of-the-art teacher models to a student model. This distillation process is guided by three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. These losses are structured to move from specific alignment to broader semantic understanding, enabling the student model to learn robust text representations. The framework also incorporates Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the student model's output vectors, addressing practical deployment challenges. The resulting Jasper model, with 2 billion parameters, achieves performance comparable to much larger 7 billion parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of this progressive constraint strategy in knowledge distillation for embedding models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper proposes a multi-stage knowledge distillation framework for embedding models, progressively transferring knowledge from multiple teacher models to a smaller student model.\n*   Three loss functions (cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss) are employed, progressing from specific to broader constraints to guide the distillation.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model.\n*   The Jasper model, trained using this framework, achieves performance comparable to larger models (7B parameters) despite having only 2B parameters, showcasing the effectiveness of the approach.",

The core of this approach is the \"progressive constraint strategy,\" where a smaller student model learns from multiple larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models. This distillation process employs three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (for aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (for semantic matching from a text-pair perspective), and relative similarity distillation loss (for learning ranking preferences). This progression from specific to broader constraints is key to effectively transferring knowledge. The framework also incorporates Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for effective dimension reduction and a stage for unlocking multimodal potential. The resulting student model, Jasper, with 2 billion parameters, achieves performance comparable to 7 billion parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating the efficacy of this progressive distillation strategy.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The proposed framework uses a multi-stage distillation with three loss functions (cosine, similarity, and relative similarity) to progressively constrain a student model to learn from multiple teacher models.\n*   This \"progressive constraint strategy\" moves from aligning absolute representations to matching semantic similarities and finally to learning ranking preferences.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is used in Stage 3 to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the distilled model.\n*   The Jasper model, trained using this method, achieves performance comparable to much larger models (7B vs. 2B parameters) on the MTEB benchmark.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper details a multi-stage knowledge distillation framework for creating efficient text embedding models, focusing on a \"progressive constraint strategy.\" The core idea is to distill knowledge from multiple large, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher embedding models into a smaller student model named Jasper. This process involves three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (ensuring consistent semantic judgment between text pairs), and relative similarity distillation loss (leveraging relative ranking information). The distillation is progressive, with stages 1 and 2 focusing on learning from teachers using these losses and gradually training more of the student model's parameters. Stage 3 addresses the challenge of high dimensionality, introduced by concatenating teacher embeddings, by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to reduce vector dimensions. Stage 4 focuses on unlocking multimodal potential by aligning visual and textual embeddings through self-distillation. Jasper, built on Stella, achieved a strong performance on the MTEB leaderboard, comparable to larger models while being significantly more efficient.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The \"progressive constraint strategy\" involves three losses: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss, to transfer knowledge from multiple teacher models to a student model.\n*   Stage 3 utilizes Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to effectively reduce the high dimensionality of the student model's embeddings, a consequence of concatenating multiple teacher outputs.\n*   Stage 4 aims to unlock multimodal capabilities by aligning visual and textual embeddings using self-distillation.\n*   The Jasper model, a 2B parameter model, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of this distillation approach.\n*   The training process is divided into four stages, each with specific objectives and parameter training strategies to progressively transfer knowledge and reduce dimensionality.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Jasper embedding model, a 2 billion parameter model that achieves state-of-the-art performance by distilling knowledge from multiple larger teacher embedding models. The distillation process is multi-stage, employing three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (for absolute representation alignment), similarity loss (for relative semantic matching between text pairs), and relative similarity distillation loss (to capture ranking preferences). This progressive approach shifts from specific to broader constraints. To address the high dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher embeddings, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is used for effective dimension reduction. Stage 4 further unlocks multimodal potential by integrating a vision encoder through self-distillation. On the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), Jasper secured the No. 3 position, demonstrating performance comparable to 7B parameter models and significantly outperforming models under 2B parameters.\n\n2.

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces a multi-stage knowledge distillation framework designed to train smaller, efficient embedding models from larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. The core of this approach lies in a progressive constraint strategy implemented through three distinct loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. These losses guide the student model to learn from multiple teacher models, moving from specific vector alignment to broader semantic and relational understanding. Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed in Stage 3 to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model, addressing the challenge of high dimensionality in SOTA models. The framework involves four stages: initial distillation (Stages 1 & 2) using SOTA teachers, dimension reduction (Stage 3), and a preliminary multimodal alignment (Stage 4). The resulting Jasper model, with 2 billion parameters, achieved a top-3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating performance comparable to 7B parameter models and significantly outperforming smaller models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   **Progressive Constraint Strategy:** The distillation framework utilizes a sequence of three losses (cosine, similarity, relative similarity) to progressively transfer knowledge from teacher to student models.\n*   **Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL):** MRL is applied in Stage 3 to effectively reduce the student model's vector dimensionality, making it more practical for real-world applications.\n*   **Multi-Stage Distillation:** The training process is divided into four stages, carefully orchestrating the transfer of knowledge from multiple SOTA teacher models.\n*   **Competitive Performance:** The Jasper model (2B parameters) achieved a top-3 ranking on the MTEB leaderboard, matching the performance of much larger 7B parameter models.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance by distilling knowledge from multiple larger teacher models. The core of their approach is a multi-stage distillation framework with three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (for aligning absolute text representations), similarity loss (for semantic matching from a text-pair perspective), and relative similarity distillation loss (for learning teacher's ranking preferences). Stages 1 and 2 focus on this distillation process, progressively training more parameters. Stage 3 addresses the challenge of high vector dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher outputs by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to effectively compress the student model's vector representations. Stage 4 explores multimodal capabilities by training a vision encoder using self-distillation. Jasper's performance on the MTEB benchmark is competitive with 7 billion parameter models and significantly surpasses models under 2 billion parameters.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper utilizes a multi-stage distillation framework with cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss to transfer knowledge from multiple teacher models.\n*   Stage 3 employs Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to reduce the student model's vector dimensionality effectively after concatenating teacher outputs.\n*   Stage 4 focuses on preliminary multimodal alignment by training a vision encoder using self-distillation with image-caption pairs.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models and significantly outperforms other models under 2B parameters on the MTEB benchmark.",

The authors, recognizing the practical limitations of large, high-dimensional embedding models, propose a method to distill knowledge from multiple teachers into a student model named Jasper. This process involves three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute text representations), similarity loss (ensuring consistent semantic judgment between text pairs), and relative similarity distillation loss (leveraging relative ranking information). Stages 1 and 2 focus on this distillation, with Stage 2 training more parameters. Stage 3 addresses the challenge of high dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher outputs by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for effective dimension reduction. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by aligning visual and textual embeddings through self-distillation. Implemented details show Jasper, built on Stella, uses a 4-stage distillation. The Jasper model (2B parameters) achieved a No.3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, showing performance comparable to 7B models and outperforming smaller models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The framework uses three progressive loss functions (cosine, similarity, relative similarity) to distill knowledge from multiple large teacher embedding models into a smaller student model.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed in Stage 3 for effective vector dimension reduction after concatenating teacher outputs.\n*   Stage 4 focuses on multimodal alignment by training a vision encoder using self-distillation.\n*   Jasper, a 2B parameter model, achieved top-tier performance on the MTEB leaderboard, comparable to 7B models, demonstrating the effectiveness of the distillation strategy.\n*   The distillation process utilizes unsupervised text data, eliminating the need for labeled datasets for the core distillation.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Jasper model, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance by employing a multi-stage knowledge distillation framework. The framework distills knowledge from multiple larger teacher embedding models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5) into the student model. This distillation process utilizes three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (Lcosine) for aligning absolute text representations, similarity loss (Lsim) for consistent semantic matching between text pairs, and relative similarity distillation loss (Lresim) for learning ranking preferences. The training progresses through four stages. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling from teachers using Lcosine, Lsim, and Lresim, with increasing parameter fine-tuning. Stage 3 addresses the high dimensionality of concatenated teacher vectors by using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for dimension reduction, primarily relying on Lsim and Lresim. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by training the vision encoder using self-distillation on image-caption pairs. Jasper's performance on the MTEB benchmark is highly competitive, achieving the No. 3 position and demonstrating results comparable to 7B parameter models, significantly outperforming other models under 2B parameters.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a multi-stage distillation framework using Lcosine, Lsim, and Lresim losses to learn from multiple teacher models.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is used in Stage 3 for effective dimension reduction of the student model's embeddings.\n*   Jasper achieved the No. 3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating performance comparable to 7B models with only 2B parameters.\n*   The distillation process leverages unsupervised text data, eliminating the need for specific supervised datasets for core distillation.\n*   Stage 4 introduces preliminary multimodal capabilities by aligning visual and textual embeddings through self-distillation.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Jasper model, a 2 billion parameter embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art performance by distilling knowledge from multiple larger teacher models. The core of their approach is a novel multi-stage distillation framework utilizing three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (Lcosine) for direct vector alignment, similarity loss (Lsim) for text-pair semantic consistency, and relative similarity distillation loss (Lresim) for preserving ranking preferences. Stages 1 and 2 focus on transferring knowledge from teachers like NV-Embed-v2 and Stella, gradually training more of the student model. Stage 3 employs Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to effectively reduce the high dimensionality (12288) resulting from concatenating teacher embeddings, using Lsim and Lresim to guide the reduction to a more manageable 512 dimensions. Stage 4 explores multimodal capabilities by aligning image and text embeddings through self-distillation. Jasper's performance on the MTEB benchmark is impressive, achieving results comparable to 7B parameter models and significantly outperforming other models under 2B parameters, demonstrating the effectiveness of their progressive constraint strategy in knowledge distillation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper, a 2B parameter embedding model, achieves performance comparable to 7B models by distilling knowledge from multiple larger teacher models.\n*   The distillation framework employs a progression of loss functions: Lcosine (absolute similarity), Lsim (pair similarity), and Lresim (relative similarity) to capture teacher knowledge.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is used in Stage 3 to reduce the high dimensionality of concatenated teacher embeddings (12288) to a more practical size (e.g., 512).\n*   The multi-stage distillation process progressively trains different parts of the student model, starting with mapping layers and progressing to deeper encoder layers.\n*   Jasper achieved the No.3 position on the MTEB leaderboard (as of Dec 24, 2024) with an average score of 71.54 across 56 datasets.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art performance by distilling knowledge from multiple larger teacher models. The distillation process is multi-stage, employing three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (Lcosine) for aligning absolute representations, similarity loss (Lsim) for matching semantic similarities between text pairs, and relative similarity distillation loss (Lresim) for preserving relative ranking preferences. Stages 1 and 2 focus on this progressive distillation, with Stage 2 further fine-tuning deeper layers of the student model. Stage 3 addresses the high dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher vectors by using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to generate lower-dimensional outputs, utilizing Lsim and Lresim. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by aligning visual and textual embeddings through self-distillation using image-caption pairs. The Jasper model, built on Stella, achieved the No. 3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating performance comparable to 7B parameter models while significantly outperforming other models under 2B parameters. Implementation details cover dataset usage, training hardware, and hyperparameter settings.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a multi-stage distillation framework using Lcosine, Lsim, and Lresim losses to learn from multiple large teacher models.\n*   Stage 3 utilizes Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to reduce vector dimensionality after initial distillation stages.\n*   Stage 4 focuses on multimodal alignment via self-distillation using image-caption data.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieved No. 3 on the MTEB leaderboard, rivaling 7B models and surpassing smaller models.\n*   The loss functions progress from specific (Lcosine) to broader (Lsim, Lresim) constraints to improve embedding learning.",
