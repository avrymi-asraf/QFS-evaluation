SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its surprising effectiveness in enhancing mathematical reasoning capabilities in certain models, specifically Qwen2.5-Math. Counterintuitively, the research demonstrates that even \"spurious\" rewards—those with little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, format adherence)—can elicit significant performance gains. These gains are comparable to those achieved with ground truth rewards, suggesting that RLVR might be surfacing latent reasoning abilities acquired during pretraining rather than teaching new ones. This effect is highly model-dependent; spurious rewards that benefit Qwen models often fail to improve others like Llama3 or OLMo2, likely due to differences in their pretraining data and inherent reasoning strategies. A key observed behavior in Qwen2.5-Math is \"code reasoning\" (using Python to assist reasoning), which increases significantly with RLVR and strongly correlates with improved accuracy. Explicitly prompting or rewarding code reasoning further boosts performance.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in models like Qwen2.5-Math even with spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format adherence).\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, with Qwen models benefiting significantly while others like Llama3 and OLMo2 show little to no improvement.\n*   RLVR appears to surface latent reasoning abilities learned during pretraining, rather than teaching new skills, particularly \"code reasoning\" in Qwen2.5-Math.\n*   Explicitly encouraging \"code reasoning\" through prompting or reward signals directly leads to performance gains in Qwen2.5-Math models.\n*   The findings suggest that pretraining data and inherent model behaviors are crucial factors in how RLVR impacts reasoning, and research should be validated across diverse models.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can elicit complex reasoning behaviors in certain language models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, even when provided with \"spurious\" or weak reward signals (e.g., incorrect labels, format adherence, random rewards). The study reveals that these weak signals can lead to significant performance gains, sometimes comparable to ground truth rewards, by effectively amplifying pre-existing reasoning strategies within the model. A key observation is Qwen2.5-Math's propensity for \"code reasoning\" – using Python code to aid mathematical problem-solving without actual execution – which RLVR significantly boosts. Crucially, this phenomenon is highly model-dependent; other model families like Llama and OLMo do not exhibit similar gains with spurious rewards, suggesting that the effectiveness of RLVR with weak signals relies on the model's pretraining data and inherent reasoning capabilities. The paper also delves into the mechanisms behind these spurious rewards, proposing that they leverage algorithmic biases (like clipping in GRPO) to upweight behaviors that, coincidentally, correlate with correctness for certain models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can elicit substantial reasoning improvements in Qwen2.5-Math models using weak or spurious reward signals, such as incorrect labels or random rewards, approaching gains from ground truth rewards.\n*   This effectiveness is attributed to RLVR upweighting pre-existing reasoning strategies, notably \"code reasoning\" (using Python for math), which is prevalent and beneficial in Qwen2.5-Math but not other tested models.\n*   The observed gains from spurious rewards do not generalize across model families; Llama and OLMo models show minimal or no improvement, highlighting the critical role of pretraining data and inherent capabilities.\n*   The study suggests that spurious rewards, particularly random ones, can provide training signals due to optimization algorithm biases (like GRPO clipping) that exploit pre-existing model behaviors, rather than providing informative feedback.",

The study demonstrates that weak or even random rewards can elicit significant performance gains, often approaching those from ground truth rewards. A key finding is that these gains are highly model-dependent; while Qwen models benefit substantially, other families like Llama and OLMo show minimal or no improvement. This divergence is attributed to pretraining differences. Specifically, Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong pre-existing \"code reasoning\" behavior (using Python code to assist in problem-solving), which RLVR, even with spurious rewards, amplifies. Directly prompting or rewarding code reasoning also boosts performance in Qwen models, but can degrade it in others. The study also highlights the GRPO optimization algorithm's clipping bias as a mechanism that can create training signals from random rewards by favoring existing model behaviors.\n\n2.  **KEY HIGHLIGHTS:**\n    *   Spurious rewards (e.g., incorrect labels, random signals) can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, sometimes matching ground truth rewards.\n    *   These improvements are not generalizable; other model families (Llama, OLMo) do not benefit from spurious rewards, indicating a strong dependency on pretraining.\n    *   Qwen2.5-Math models' proficiency in \"code reasoning\" (using code to aid problem-solving) is a key factor; RLVR amplifies this pre-existing strategy.\n    *   Directly prompting or rewarding code reasoning also enhances Qwen model performance, suggesting it's a core mechanism.\n    *   The GRPO algorithm's clipping bias can create effective training signals from random rewards by exploiting pre-existing model behaviors, explaining why random rewards work for some models but not others.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how \"spurious rewards\" in Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can unexpectedly improve mathematical reasoning in certain language models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math. The study reveals that even rewards with no or negative correlation to the correct answer, such as rewarding specific output formats or entirely random rewards, can elicit significant performance gains. This effect is largely attributed to RLVR's ability to surface and amplify latent reasoning capabilities acquired during pretraining. For instance, Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong tendency towards \"code reasoning\" (using Python-like code snippets for problem-solving), which RLVR significantly boosts, leading to higher accuracy. This phenomenon is model-dependent; other model families like Llama and OLMo do not show similar gains with spurious rewards, suggesting their pretraining data did not instill comparable reasoning strategies. The paper also highlights the role of the GRPO optimization algorithm's clipping bias in amplifying these pre-existing behaviors, even with random rewards, and warns against generalizing RLVR findings across different model architectures.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   **Format Rewards & Spurious Gains:** Rewarding specific output formats (like the presence of `\\boxed{}`) or even random rewards can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, often approaching gains seen with ground truth rewards.\n*   **Code Reasoning Amplification:** RLVR, even with spurious rewards, substantially increases the frequency of \"code reasoning\" (using code-like structures for problem-solving) in Qwen2.5-Math models, which strongly correlates with improved performance.\n*   **Model-Specific Efficacy:** The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent. Qwen2.5-Math models benefit greatly, while other families like Llama and OLMo show minimal or negative gains, indicating pretraining differences are key.\n*   **GRPO Clipping Bias:** The GRPO optimization algorithm's clipping mechanism can create a training signal from random rewards by amplifying pre-existing, high-probability behaviors, explaining why spurious rewards work for models with strong latent reasoning skills.\n*   **RLVR vs. Pretraining:** RLVR appears to primarily surface and amplify existing reasoning capabilities from pretraining rather than teaching entirely new ones, especially when weak or spurious rewards are used.",

Counterintuitively, the study finds that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in certain models, like Qwen2.5-Math, even when using rewards that are random, incorrect, or only based on output format, not correctness. These gains, often approaching those from ground truth rewards, are attributed not to teaching new skills but to eliciting latent reasoning abilities acquired during pretraining. A key observed behavior is \"code reasoning,\" where models generate Python code to aid their reasoning process. RLVR amplifies this code reasoning in Qwen models, leading to performance improvements. However, this effect is highly model-dependent, with other families like Llama and OLMo showing little to no benefit from spurious rewards, suggesting that pretraining data and learned reasoning strategies are crucial. The paper also touches upon the role of GRPO's clipping bias in amplifying existing behaviors and the sensitivity of models to prompts.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can elicit substantial reasoning improvements in models like Qwen2.5-Math even with weak or spurious reward signals (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format).\n*   These gains are hypothesized to stem from RLVR's ability to surface latent reasoning capabilities learned during pretraining, rather than teaching new skills.\n*   \"Code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid problem-solving) is a key behavior amplified by RLVR in Qwen models, strongly correlating with performance gains.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; other model families like Llama and OLMo do not show similar improvements, highlighting the role of pretraining.\n*   GRPO's clipping mechanism can act as a training signal by amplifying existing, high-probability behaviors, explaining why spurious rewards can work for certain models.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates how Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can elicit complex reasoning behaviors in language models, even when provided with \"spurious\" or weak reward signals that have little to no correlation with the correct answer. The research demonstrates that for specific models like Qwen2.5-Math, RLVR with rewards like random assignments, incorrect labels, or mere format adherence can lead to significant performance improvements on mathematical reasoning tasks.

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can elicit complex reasoning behaviors in language models, particularly focusing on the Qwen2.5-Math models. Counterintuitively, the study demonstrates that even \"spurious\" reward signals—such as rewarding correct formatting, incorrect labels, or even random rewards—can lead to significant improvements in mathematical reasoning. These weak or flawed rewards achieve performance gains comparable to ground truth rewards on Qwen2.5-Math models. A key finding is that this effectiveness is model-dependent; other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2 do not show similar gains with these spurious rewards. The research hypothesizes that RLVR, especially with weak signals, surfaces latent reasoning representations learned during pretraining. For Qwen2.5-Math, this often manifests as \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid reasoning), which increases dramatically with RLVR, even with spurious rewards. Explicitly inducing code reasoning through prompting or a specific \"Python reward\" also boosts performance, confirming its role in the observed gains.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Spurious rewards (format, incorrect labels, random) can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, rivaling ground truth rewards.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, with Qwen2.5-Math showing gains while Llama3 and OLMo2 do not.\n*   RLVR, especially with weak rewards, appears to elicit pre-existing reasoning capabilities, particularly \"code reasoning\" in Qwen2.5-Math models.\n*   Explicitly prompting or rewarding code reasoning increases performance, suggesting it's a key mechanism for spurious reward efficacy in Qwen2.5-Math.\n*   The study emphasizes the need to validate RLVR findings across diverse models, as results on Qwen models may not generalize.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates how superficial interventions, specifically Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), can elicit complex reasoning behaviors in language models, particularly the Qwen2.5-Math family. Counterintuitively, the study demonstrates that even \"spurious\" rewards, such as those based on output format, incorrect labels, or even random assignments, can lead to significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning tasks. For instance, format rewards (rewarding the presence of a `\\boxed{}` token) improved MATH-500 performance by 13.8%. More strikingly, random rewards achieved a 21.4% absolute performance gain, and incorrect label rewards yielded a 24.1% gain, approaching the performance of ground truth rewards. These spurious rewards primarily work by surfacing and upweighting pre-existing reasoning strategies within the model, notably \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to assist in problem-solving). Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong propensity for code reasoning, which RLVR further amplifies, increasing its frequency from 65% to over 90%, leading to substantial accuracy improvements. However, this elicitation effect is highly model-dependent, with other model families like Llama and OLMo showing minimal or no gains from spurious rewards.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Format rewards, which incentivize specific output structures like `\\boxed{}`, improved Qwen2.5-Math performance by 13.8% on MATH-500.\n*   Random rewards led to a 21.4% absolute performance gain on Qwen2.5-Math, demonstrating that even uninformative signals can elicit improvements.\n*   Spurious rewards, including incorrect labels and random signals, significantly increase the frequency of \"code reasoning\" (using Python for mathematical thought) in Qwen2.5-Math models, from 65% to over 90%.\n*   The effectiveness of these superficial interventions is highly model-specific, with Qwen2.5-Math models benefiting significantly while other families like Llama and OLMo show little to no improvement.\n*   The GRPO reinforcement learning algorithm's clipping bias is identified as a mechanism that can provide a training signal from random rewards by exploiting pre-existing model behaviors.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates how Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can elicit complex reasoning behaviors in language models, particularly focusing on the Qwen2.5-Math family. Counterintuitively, the research demonstrates that even weak or entirely spurious reward signals (like random or incorrect answers) can lead to significant performance improvements on mathematical reasoning tasks. These gains are achieved not by teaching new capabilities but by surfacing latent reasoning abilities learned during pretraining. A key finding is that the Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong tendency towards \"code reasoning\" (using Python to assist in problem-solving), which is significantly amplified by RLVR, even with spurious rewards. This code reasoning strategy is highly predictive of performance. Crucially, these positive effects of spurious rewards are not universal; they fail to generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, highlighting the model-dependent nature of RLVR's effectiveness and the importance of pre-training data. The study also explores how the GRPO optimization algorithm's clipping bias can create training signals from random rewards by favoring pre-existing model behaviors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Spurious reward signals (random, incorrect labels, format adherence) can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, often comparable to ground truth rewards.\n*   This improvement is attributed to RLVR eliciting and amplifying pre-existing reasoning strategies within the model, particularly \"code reasoning\" (using Python).\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; Qwen2.5-Math models benefit significantly, while Llama3 and OLMo2 models show minimal or negative gains.\n*   The GRPO algorithm's clipping mechanism can inadvertently create training signals from random rewards by reinforcing the model's dominant pre-existing behaviors, such as code reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math.\n*   Explicitly prompting models to use code reasoning also boosts performance in Qwen2.5-Math, further supporting the idea that RLVR leverages and amplifies these internal strategies.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its surprising effectiveness with \"spurious\" reward signals, such as those based on output format or even random values, particularly for Qwen2.5-Math models. The study reveals that these weak or incorrect rewards can significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance, often approaching the gains achieved with ground truth rewards. A key finding is that this effect is highly model-dependent; while Qwen2.5-Math models show substantial improvements, other models like Llama3 and OLMo2 do not.\n\nThe research posits that RLVR, especially with spurious rewards, elicits pre-existing reasoning capabilities within the model rather than teaching new ones. For Qwen2.5-Math, this often manifests as an increased \"code reasoning\" behavior – using Python code to aid mathematical problem-solving, even without execution. This code reasoning is strongly correlated with improved accuracy. Furthermore, the study explores how the GRPO optimization algorithm's clipping bias can create a meaningful training signal from random rewards by amplifying existing model behaviors. Prompting interventions that encourage code reasoning also boost performance in Qwen models, highlighting the impact of pre-trained reasoning strategies.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Spurious reward signals (format, random, incorrect) can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, comparable to ground truth rewards.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, with Qwen models benefiting significantly while Llama and OLMo models do not.\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards appears to elicit and upweight pre-existing reasoning patterns, such as \"code reasoning\" (using Python for math), which correlates with improved accuracy in Qwen models.\n*   GRPO's clipping bias can create a training signal from random rewards by reinforcing the model's pre-trained behaviors, particularly effective when those behaviors (like code reasoning in Qwen) align with correctness.\n*   Prompting interventions that encourage code reasoning also boost performance in Qwen models, underscoring the importance of pre-trained reasoning strategies.",
