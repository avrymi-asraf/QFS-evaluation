SUMMARY:\nThe Jasper paper details a staged training methodology designed to distill knowledge from large, state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding models into a smaller, more efficient student model. This approach is motivated by the practical challenges of deploying large models with high dimensionality in real-world scenarios, such as slow inference and high storage costs. The multi-stage process begins with aligning the student model's output with multiple teacher models using a combination of carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (for absolute representation similarity), similarity loss (for semantic matching between text pairs), and relative similarity distillation loss (for learning ranking preferences). This is followed by a dimension reduction stage utilizing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to compress the high-dimensional student embeddings. A final stage introduces multimodal capabilities by aligning visual embeddings with textual ones through self-distillation. This staged, multi-loss distillation strategy allows the smaller Jasper model to achieve performance comparable to much larger models, demonstrating the effectiveness of this structured knowledge transfer.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The staged training methodology addresses the practical limitations of large embedding models by distilling knowledge into a smaller student model.\n*   A three-loss function approach (cosine, similarity, and relative similarity distillation) is used to progressively transfer knowledge from multiple teacher models to the student.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed in a dedicated stage to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the student model's vector representations.\n*   The multi-stage process enables the student model to learn from diverse perspectives, from specific vector alignment to broader ranking preferences.\n*   This distillation strategy allows a 2B parameter model to achieve performance comparable to 7B parameter models, making SOTA embedding technology more accessible.",

SUMMARY:\nThe paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, achieved through a multi-stage distillation framework designed to transfer knowledge from larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models. The rationale for this staged training methodology lies in addressing the practical limitations of SOTA models, which often suffer from high parameter counts and vector dimensionality, leading to slow inference and high storage costs. The distillation process employs three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. These losses progressively guide the student model to learn from specific (cosine loss) to broader (similarity and relative similarity losses) perspectives of the teacher models' representations. Stages 1 and 2 focus on this initial distillation using two teacher models, adjusting the student's parameters to align with concatenated teacher vectors. Stage 3 then utilizes Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to effectively reduce the dimensionality of these vectors, employing only similarity-based losses for the reduced dimensions while retaining cosine loss for the full-dimension vectors. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by using self-distillation to align visual and textual embeddings. This multi-stage approach allows Jasper to achieve performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, demonstrating the efficacy of staged distillation for creating efficient yet powerful embedding models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The staged training methodology addresses the practical limitations of large embedding models (high parameter count, high dimensionality) by distilling knowledge from multiple SOTA teacher models into a smaller student model (Jasper).\n*   Three distinct loss functions (cosine, similarity, and relative similarity) are employed across stages to progressively guide the student model's learning, moving from specific vector alignment to broader semantic and ranking preferences.\n*   Stage 3 incorporates Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to effectively reduce the student model's vector dimensionality, making it more practical for real-world applications.\n*   Stage 4 focuses on unlocking multimodal capabilities through self-distillation, aligning visual and textual embeddings.\n*   Jasper, trained with this multi-stage distillation, achieves performance comparable to much larger 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, validating the approach.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThe Jasper embedding model employs a novel multi-stage distillation framework to transfer knowledge from larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models to a smaller student model. This process is crucial for creating efficient yet powerful embedding models for real-world applications, addressing the challenges of high parameter counts and vector dimensionality in SOTA models. The distillation utilizes three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (ensuring consistent semantic judgment between text pairs), and relative similarity distillation loss (leveraging ranking preferences).\n\nThe training is structured across four stages. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from multiple teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5) using the three proposed loss functions, progressively training more parameters of the student model. Stage 3 addresses the issue of high vector dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher outputs by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers, focusing on similarity and relative similarity losses. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by using image-caption pairs for self-distillation, aligning visual and textual embeddings. This comprehensive approach allows Jasper to achieve SOTA performance at the 2B parameter scale, comparable to 7B models, as demonstrated by its strong performance on the MTEB benchmark.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   **Rationale for Staged Distillation:** The multi-stage distillation process is designed to efficiently transfer knowledge from large, high-dimensional SOTA embedding models to a smaller student model, overcoming practical limitations of inference speed and storage cost.\n*   **Loss Functions for Distillation:** Three distinct loss functions (cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss) are used to capture different aspects of teacher knowledge, progressing from specific vector alignment to broader semantic and relative ranking preferences.\n*   **Dimension Reduction via MRL:** Stage 3 uses Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers to effectively reduce the student model's vector dimensionality without sacrificing performance, addressing the issue of concatenated teacher vectors.\n*   **Multimodal Alignment:** Stage 4 focuses on aligning visual and textual embeddings through self-distillation using image-caption pairs, enhancing the model's multimodal capabilities.\n*   **Performance on MTEB:** The Jasper model, with 2 billion parameters, achieves performance comparable to 7 billion parameter models and significantly outperforms other models in its size class on the MTEB benchmark.",

The rationale behind this staged approach is to efficiently transfer knowledge from larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding models to a smaller student model. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from multiple teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5) using three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss for direct representation alignment, similarity loss for semantic matching, and relative similarity distillation loss for ranking preferences. This progressive approach, with different parameter training strategies in each stage, aims to improve robustness and performance. Stage 3 addresses the challenge of high vector dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher outputs. It employs Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers to create compressed, lower-dimensional vectors, utilizing only similarity and relative similarity losses. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by training the vision encoder using self-distillation, aligning image embeddings with text embeddings from a caption. This multi-stage methodology allows Jasper to achieve performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of knowledge distillation for creating efficient yet powerful embedding models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A multi-stage distillation framework is employed to transfer knowledge from larger teacher models to a smaller student model (Jasper), addressing the practical limitations of SOTA embedding models.\n*   Stages 1 and 2 use cosine, similarity, and relative similarity losses to progressively align student and teacher representations, with varying parameter training in each stage for optimal knowledge transfer.\n*   Stage 3 utilizes Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to reduce the high dimensionality of concatenated teacher embeddings, focusing on similarity-based losses.\n*   Stage 4 introduces multimodal capabilities by self-distilling image embeddings to align with text embeddings, further enhancing the model's versatility.",

The primary goal is to create a smaller, more efficient model that matches the performance of larger ones. The staged approach begins with distilling knowledge from multiple large teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella) over two stages, employing a progression of loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (ensuring consistent semantic judgment between text pairs), and relative similarity distillation loss (leveraging ranking information). This multi-stage process allows the student model to learn from diverse perspectives. Stage 3 focuses on dimension reduction using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to create manageable vector sizes from concatenated teacher outputs, utilizing similarity and relative similarity losses. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by aligning visual and textual embeddings using self-distillation with image-caption pairs. This comprehensive training strategy resulted in Jasper achieving a No. 3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating performance comparable to 7B parameter models despite its 2B parameter size.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The staged training methodology is designed to distill knowledge from multiple large teacher models into a smaller student model, addressing the practical challenges of high dimensionality and parameter count in SOTA embedding models.\n*   A progression of three carefully designed losses (cosine, similarity, and relative similarity) is used across the initial stages to capture absolute representations, semantic consistency, and ranking preferences from teacher models.\n*   Stage 3 employs Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for effective dimension reduction of the student model's output, crucial for practical deployment.\n*   Stage 4 focuses on multimodal capabilities by aligning visual and textual embeddings, enhancing the model's versatility.\n*   Jasper's performance on the MTEB benchmark showcases its ability to achieve results comparable to much larger models, validating the efficacy of the staged distillation approach.",

This process is structured across four stages. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from multiple teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5) using three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (ensuring consistent semantic matching), and relative similarity distillation loss (leveraging ranking preferences). Stage 3 addresses the high dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher vectors by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to progressively reduce vector dimensions, utilizing only similarity and relative similarity losses for the reduced dimensions and all three for the initial concatenated output. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by using image-caption pairs for self-distillation to align visual and textual embeddings. This staged approach allows Jasper, with 2 billion parameters, to achieve performance comparable to 7 billion parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, securing the No. 3 position.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The staged training approach utilizes three key loss functions (cosine, similarity, relative similarity) to progressively distill knowledge from multiple large teacher models.\n*   Stage 3 employs Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to effectively reduce the high dimensionality of the student model's embeddings.\n*   Stage 4 introduces multimodal capabilities by aligning visual and textual embeddings through self-distillation.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieves comparable performance to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of the distillation strategy.",

This approach addresses the practical challenges of high parameter counts and vector dimensionality in SOTA models. The distillation process is guided by three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (preserving semantic matching between text pairs), and relative similarity distillation loss (learning ranking preferences). Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from multiple teachers (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5) using these losses, with varying parameter training. Stage 3 utilizes Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to reduce the high dimensionality (12288) resulting from teacher concatenation, employing only similarity-based losses for the reduced dimensions while retaining cosine loss for the initial concatenated vectors. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by aligning visual encoder embeddings with text embeddings using self-distillation on image-caption pairs. This staged methodology results in the Jasper model, a 2B parameter model that achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A multi-stage distillation process using cosine, similarity, and relative similarity losses is employed to transfer knowledge from larger teacher models to a smaller student model.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized in Stage 3 to effectively reduce the high dimensionality of the student model's embeddings.\n*   Stage 4 focuses on multimodal capabilities by aligning visual embeddings with textual embeddings through self-distillation.\n*   The staged training allows a 2B parameter Jasper model to achieve performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark.",

SUMMARY:\nThe paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, developed using a multi-stage distillation framework to learn from larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models like NV-Embed-v2 and Stella. The rationale for this staged training is to create a highly performant yet more efficient model. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from multiple teachers using three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (ensuring consistent semantic judgment between text pairs), and relative similarity distillation loss (leveraging ranking preferences). This process progressively trains the student model, starting with a mapping layer and then fine-tuning encoder layers. Stage 3 addresses the high dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher vectors by employing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to compress vectors to manageable sizes (e.g., 512 dimensions), primarily using similarity-based losses. Stage 4 aims to unlock multimodal potential by aligning visual and textual embeddings through self-distillation, using image-caption pairs. Jasper's performance on the MTEB benchmark demonstrates its competitiveness with 7B models while being significantly more efficient.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The staged training methodology (4 stages) is designed to progressively transfer knowledge from multiple SOTA teacher models to a smaller student model (Jasper).\n*   Three distinct loss functions—cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss—are used across stages to guide the distillation process from specific to broader semantic understanding.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed in Stage 3 to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the student model's embeddings, addressing the issue of high vector dimensions from concatenated teacher outputs.\n*   Stage 4 focuses on unlocking multimodal capabilities by aligning visual and textual embeddings through self-distillation, using image-caption pairs.\n*   Jasper achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of the staged distillation approach for creating efficient, high-performing embedding models.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper details the staged training methodology for the Jasper embedding model, a 2 billion parameter model designed to distill knowledge from larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. The rationale behind this multi-stage approach is to efficiently transfer the capabilities of powerful but resource-intensive teacher models (like NV-Embed-v2 and Stella) into a more compact student model. Stages 1 and 2 focus on this distillation process, employing three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute text representations), similarity loss (ensuring consistent semantic judgments between text pairs), and relative similarity distillation loss (leveraging relative ranking information). Stage 3 addresses the practical challenge of high vector dimensionality inherited from the teachers by implementing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL), allowing for effective dimension reduction to a more manageable size. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by aligning visual and textual embeddings through self-distillation. The Jasper model, trained using this staged methodology, achieved a No.3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating performance comparable to much larger 7B parameter models, validating the effectiveness of the staged training strategy.\n\n2.

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper details the staged training methodology for the Jasper embedding model, a 2 billion parameter model designed to distill knowledge from larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. The rationale behind this multi-stage approach is to efficiently transfer the capabilities of powerful but resource-intensive teacher models (like NV-Embed-v2 and Stella) into a more compact student model. Stages 1 and 2 focus on this distillation process, employing three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute text representations), similarity loss (ensuring consistent semantic judgments between text pairs), and relative similarity distillation loss (leveraging relative ranking information). Stage 3 addresses the practical challenge of high vector dimensionality inherited from the teachers by implementing Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL), allowing for effective dimension reduction to a more manageable size. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by aligning visual and textual embeddings through self-distillation. The Jasper model, trained using this staged methodology, achieved a No.3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating performance comparable to much larger 7B parameter models, validating the effectiveness of the staged training strategy.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The multi-stage training methodology is employed to distill knowledge from multiple large SOTA embedding models (teachers) into a smaller student model (Jasper, 2B parameters).\n*   Three specific loss functions (cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss) are used across stages 1 and 2 to progressively transfer knowledge from teachers to the student.\n*   Stage 3 utilizes Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for effective dimension reduction of the student model's output vectors, addressing the high dimensionality inherited from teachers.\n*   Stage 4 focuses on multimodal alignment by integrating a vision encoder and using self-distillation to link visual and textual embeddings.\n*   The staged approach allows Jasper (2B parameters) to achieve performance comparable to larger 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness.",
