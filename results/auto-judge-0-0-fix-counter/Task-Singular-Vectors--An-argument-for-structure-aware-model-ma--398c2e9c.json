      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper argues for a structure-aware approach to model manipulation, specifically in the context of model merging, contrasting it with flattened parameter methods like Task Arithmetic. The authors propose analyzing per-layer task matrices using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract \"Task Singular Vectors\" (TSVs). They demonstrate that these layer-wise task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs can represent a significant portion of a task's function. This observation leads to TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a method that compresses task vectors to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% accuracy. More importantly, the interaction between TSVs from different tasks provides a fine-grained measure of task interference. Building on this, TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines this compression with a novel interference reduction technique (whitening the TSVs) to significantly outperform existing methods. The approach leverages the structural properties of neural networks at the layer level, offering a more effective and efficient way to merge models compared to treating them as flat vectors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Flattened parameter approaches to model merging overlook crucial structural information, leading to susceptibility to task interference.\n*   Analyzing per-layer task matrices via SVD reveals a low-rank structure, allowing for compression (TSV-C) and a novel measure of task interference (STI).\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines low-rank compression with interference reduction by orthogonalizing Task Singular Vectors (TSVs), achieving state-of-the-art performance.\n*   Structure-aware manipulation at the layer level, using TSVs, provides a more effective way to manage task interactions and improve model merging outcomes.",

Unlike flattened parameter approaches that overlook structural information and are prone to task interference, this method utilizes Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) to capture task-specific contributions. The research demonstrates that these layer task matrices are inherently low-rank, enabling significant compression. The proposed TSV-Compress (TSV-C) method reduces task vectors to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% accuracy. Furthermore, by analyzing the interplay of TSVs from different tasks, a measure of Singular Task Interference (STI) is introduced. This understanding leads to TSV-Merge (TSV-M), a novel model merging technique that combines compression with interference reduction through a whitening transformation of TSVs. TSV-M significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results by effectively mitigating task interference and improving overall performance. An ablation study confirms that both compression and interference reduction are crucial for optimal performance.\n\n2.

The core idea is to analyze task-specific weight changes at the layer level using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This analysis reveals that per-layer task matrices are often low-rank, meaning a small number of singular vectors (Task Singular Vectors or TSVs) capture most of the task-specific information. Leveraging this, the authors propose TSV-Compress (TSV-C), which compresses task vectors by retaining only a fraction of TSVs, reducing storage by 90% while maintaining 99% accuracy. Crucially, the interaction between TSVs from different tasks is used to define and measure \"Singular Task Interference\" (STI). Based on this, TSV-Merge (TSV-M) is introduced, which combines TSV-C's compression with an interference reduction step (via whitening of TSVs) to significantly improve model merging performance, outperforming existing methods by an average of 15% accuracy. An ablation study confirms that both low-rank approximation and interference reduction are vital for TSV-M's success.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Proposes a structure-aware approach by analyzing per-layer task matrices using SVD, identifying them as low-rank and represented by Task Singular Vectors (TSVs).\n*   Introduces TSV-Compress (TSV-C) for efficient storage, reducing task vectors to 10% of their size while retaining 99% accuracy.\n*   Defines and utilizes Singular Task Interference (STI) based on TSV interactions to develop TSV-Merge (TSV-M).\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines compression and interference reduction, achieving state-of-the-art performance in model merging, significantly outperforming flattened parameter approaches.\n*   Ablation studies confirm that both low-rank approximation and interference reduction are crucial components of TSV-M's superior performance.",

The authors introduce \"Task Singular Vectors\" (TSVs) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices. They demonstrate that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs can represent a task's contribution with high fidelity. This insight leads to TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a method that compresses task vectors to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% accuracy. Crucially, the paper proposes TSV-Merge (TSV-M), which leverages TSVs not only for compression but also to quantify and reduce \"Singular Task Interference\" (STI) by analyzing the alignment of singular vectors across tasks. By decorrelating these vectors through a whitening transformation, TSV-M significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results by effectively mitigating task interference, a problem inherent in flattened parameter approaches.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Per-layer task matrices are inherently low-rank, allowing for efficient representation and compression using a small subset of Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) derived from SVD.\n*   TSV-Compress (TSV-C) achieves significant compression (10x) while retaining high accuracy (99%), offering a more efficient storage solution than flattened approaches.\n*   Singular Task Interference (STI) is proposed as a fine-grained measure of cross-task conflict, analyzed through the alignment of TSVs.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines low-rank approximation with interference reduction via TSVs and whitening, leading to substantial performance improvements over flattened methods like Task Arithmetic.\n*   Ablation studies confirm that both low-rank approximation and interference reduction are crucial for TSV-M's superior performance, with interference reduction being the dominant factor.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\n\nThis paper introduces a novel approach to model merging that prioritizes structure-aware manipulation over flattened parameter methods, addressing limitations of existing techniques like Task Arithmetic (TA). The core idea is to leverage Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on per-layer task matrices, extracting \"Task Singular Vectors\" (TSVs). The research demonstrates that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs can represent a task's contribution with high fidelity. This insight leads to TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a compression method that reduces task vector size by 90% while retaining 99% accuracy. Furthermore, the paper proposes TSV-Merge (TSV-M), which combines this compression with a new measure of \"Singular Task Interference\" (STI). By decorrelating TSVs across tasks, TSV-M effectively reduces interference, significantly outperforming prior model merging methods and establishing a new state-of-the-art. An ablation study confirms that both low-rank approximation and interference reduction are crucial for TSV-M's success.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n*   **Structure-Aware Manipulation:** The paper advocates for analyzing and manipulating model parameters at the layer level using SVD (Task Singular Vectors - TSVs), moving beyond flattened parameter approaches.\n*   **Low-Rank Property:** Task matrices are shown to be inherently low-rank, enabling significant compression (TSV-Compress) with minimal accuracy loss.\n*   **Interference Reduction:** A novel measure of task interference (STI) is introduced, based on the interaction of TSVs, and used to develop TSV-Merge (TSV-M).\n*   **TSV-Merge Performance:** TSV-M, combining compression and interference reduction, significantly outperforms existing model merging techniques, achieving state-of-the-art results.\n*   **Component Contributions:** Ablation studies confirm that both low-rank approximation and interference reduction are vital for TSV-M's superior performance.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces a novel approach to model merging by moving beyond flattened parameter representations and focusing on the inherent structure of neural networks at the layer level. The core idea is to leverage Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on per-layer task matrices, extracting \"Task Singular Vectors\" (TSVs). The authors demonstrate that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs can represent a task's contribution with high fidelity. This observation leads to TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a method that compresses task vectors significantly (e.g., to 10% of their size) while retaining high accuracy. Crucially, the paper also introduces a measure of \"Singular Task Interference\" (STI) based on the interaction of TSVs from different tasks. This understanding is then used to develop TSV-Merge (TSV-M), a model merging technique that combines compression with interference reduction by decorrelating TSVs. TSV-M significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results by effectively managing task interference and leveraging the structured, low-rank nature of layer-wise task representations.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces a novel approach to model merging that moves beyond flattened parameter representations by leveraging the structure-aware Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices. The authors identify that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of Singular Vectors, termed Task Singular Vectors (TSVs), can represent the layer's function with high fidelity. This insight leads to TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a method that compresses task vectors to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% of accuracy. More importantly, the interaction of TSVs across different tasks provides a geometrically informed way to measure and reduce task interference, a key limitation of prior methods. This is addressed by TSV-Merge (TSV-M), which combines TSV-C with a whitening transformation on the TSVs to decorrelate them, significantly outperforming existing model merging techniques by reducing task interference and achieving state-of-the-art results. The approach demonstrates that structure-aware manipulation of model parameters, specifically through TSVs, is more effective than flattened approaches for both compression and mitigating task interference.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Task matrices are inherently low-rank, allowing for significant compression using Task Singular Vectors (TSVs).\n*   TSV-Compress (TSV-C) achieves 10x compression of task vectors while retaining 99% accuracy.\n*   Task interference can be effectively measured and reduced by analyzing the geometric interactions (alignment) of TSVs across tasks.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines low-rank approximation and TSV-based interference reduction to achieve state-of-the-art model merging performance.\n*   This structure-aware approach offers a significant advantage over flattened parameter manipulation methods for model merging.",

KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Per-layer task matrices are inherently low-rank, allowing for compression by focusing on Task Singular Vectors (TSVs).\n*   TSV-Compress (TSV-C) achieves significant compression (10x) while preserving high accuracy (99%).\n*   Task interference can be effectively measured and reduced by analyzing the interaction of TSVs across tasks.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines compression and interference reduction, outperforming flattened parameter approaches by reducing task interference.\n*   Ablation studies show that interference reduction is the primary driver of performance gains in TSV-M, though compression is also beneficial.",
