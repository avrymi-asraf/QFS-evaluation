SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to uncover whether Large Language Models (LLMs) over-rely on surface-level cues in benchmark datasets rather than demonstrating true language understanding. C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts while preserving semantic content and labels, and then analyzes performance degradation. Applied to the MMLU benchmark across 26 LLMs, C-BOD revealed that most models (20 out of 26) exhibited statistically significant performance drops under modest perturbations, averaging 2.15%. Notably, larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy tended to be more sensitive to these rephrasings, indicating a greater reliance on fixed prompt patterns. In contrast, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy showed less degradation, suggesting a reduced dependency on superficial cues. This work challenges the reliance on leaderboard scores and advocates for prioritizing resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation, highlighting differential robustness across LLM architectural families.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs often overfit to benchmark-specific surface cues, leading to performance drops when prompts are rephrased, even if semantic content is preserved.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy generally exhibit greater performance degradation under prompt perturbations, indicating a potential over-reliance on memorized patterns.\n*   The Llama family of models demonstrated more robust performance, showing less degradation when prompts were rephrased, suggesting a reduced dependency on superficial cues compared to other families.\n*   The C-BOD framework highlights that the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy are more resilient to prompt variations, indicating differential robustness across LLM architectural families.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify overfitting in Large Language Models (LLMs) by systematically perturbing benchmark prompts while preserving semantic content. When applied to the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs, C-BOD revealed that many models exhibit significant performance degradation (average 2.15%) under these rephrasings, indicating a reliance on superficial cues rather than true language understanding. The study found a concerning trend: larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy are generally more susceptible to performance drops when prompts are altered, suggesting they overfit to fixed prompt patterns. Conversely, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy demonstrated greater robustness, implying a reduced dependency on surface-level features. C-BOD's dataset- and model-agnostic design allows for integration into training pipelines to promote more generalized language understanding. However, limitations include potential oversight of deeper overfitting forms and increased computational costs for iterative rephrasing during training.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   **C-BOD Framework:** A meta-evaluation tool that detects LLM overfitting by rephrasing benchmark prompts, assessing performance changes, and using statistical tests for significance.\n*   **Overfitting in LLMs:** Many LLMs over-rely on surface-level cues and memorized patterns within benchmark prompts, leading to performance drops when these prompts are altered.\n*   **Model Size vs. Robustness:** Larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to prompt rephrasing, exhibiting greater performance degradation, suggesting a correlation between size and overfitting.\n*   **Accuracy vs. Robustness:** Models with higher baseline accuracy on standard benchmarks often show larger performance declines under perturbations, indicating that high scores may mask an over-reliance on specific prompt structures.\n*   **Limitations of C-BOD:** The framework may not capture deeper forms of overfitting beyond textual rephrasing and integrating it into training can be computationally expensive.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify LLM overfitting to benchmark-specific surface cues. By systematically rephrasing prompts while preserving semantic content, C-BOD exposes LLMs that rely on memorized patterns rather than genuine language understanding. Evaluating 26 LLMs on the MMLU benchmark, the study found that most models experience a performance degradation under these perturbations, indicating widespread overfitting. Notably, larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more sensitive to rephrasing, suggesting a correlation between model scale/performance and reliance on fixed prompt patterns. In contrast, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy demonstrated greater resilience, indicating reduced dependency on superficial cues. The C-BOD framework is dataset- and model-agnostic, offering a method to promote more robust language understanding by moving beyond leaderboard scores. Limitations include the focus on textual rephrasing and potential computational costs for integration into training pipelines.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD detects LLM overfitting by rephrasing benchmark prompts, revealing reliance on surface cues over true understanding.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy are generally more susceptible to performance drops when prompts are rephrased, suggesting a trade-off between scale/performance and robustness.\n*   The Llama family of models exhibited significant resilience to prompt rephrasing, indicating a lower dependency on superficial patterns compared to other architectures.\n*   The study highlights a paradox where high benchmark scores may mask underlying vulnerabilities to prompt variations, emphasizing the need for more robust evaluation methods.\n*   C-BOD is a dataset- and model-agnostic framework that can be integrated into evaluation pipelines to foster more generalizable language understanding.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to identify LLMs that over-rely on superficial cues within benchmark prompts, rather than demonstrating true language understanding. By systematically rephrasing benchmark questions while preserving semantic meaning, C-BOD quantifies performance degradation under these perturbations. Evaluations on the MMLU benchmark across 26 LLMs revealed an average accuracy drop of 2.15%, with 20 models showing statistically significant performance declines. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy exhibited greater sensitivity to rephrasing, suggesting a tendency to overfit fixed prompt patterns. In contrast, the Llama family and models with lower initial accuracy demonstrated more robust performance, indicating reduced dependency on surface-level features. The C-BOD framework is dataset- and model-agnostic, offering a method to promote more generalized language understanding by moving beyond leaderboard scores.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLMs often overfit to benchmark-specific surface cues, leading to performance drops when prompts are rephrased, as demonstrated by an average 2.15% accuracy decrease across 26 models on MMLU.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy are more susceptible to performance degradation under prompt perturbations, suggesting a reliance on memorized patterns.\n*   The Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy showed greater robustness to prompt rephrasing, indicating less dependency on superficial cues.\n*   C-BOD, a dataset- and model-agnostic framework, systematically distorts prompts to detect overfitting, highlighting the need to prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to uncover LLM overfitting to benchmark-specific surface cues. C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic content and labels, revealing whether performance is driven by memorized patterns rather than true language understanding. Evaluated on the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs, C-BOD demonstrated an average performance degradation of 2.15% under modest rephrasing. Notably, larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy exhibited greater performance drops, suggesting a reliance on fixed prompt patterns. In contrast, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy showed less degradation, indicating reduced dependency on superficial cues. The methodology involves generating perturbed datasets, evaluating models on both original and perturbed data, and using McNemar's test for statistical significance of performance differences. This work challenges current LLM evaluation practices, advocating for a focus on resilience and generalization beyond leaderboard scores.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   **C-BOD Framework:** Introduces a meta-evaluation framework that detects LLM overfitting by systematically rephrasing benchmark prompts, preserving semantics but altering surface-level cues.\n*   **Overfitting in LLMs:** Most evaluated LLMs (20/26) showed significant performance degradation on rephrased prompts, indicating a reliance on benchmark-specific patterns over true understanding.\n*   **Model Size vs. Robustness:** Larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to prompt rephrasing, exhibiting greater performance declines, suggesting they may over-rely on fixed patterns.\n*   **Accuracy vs. Robustness:** Models with higher baseline accuracy on original benchmarks showed larger performance drops under perturbation, highlighting a paradox where high scores might mask underlying vulnerabilities.\n*   **LLM Evaluation Challenges:** The study underscores that high benchmark scores can be misleading due to overfitting, necessitating evaluation methods that prioritize resilience and generalization.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD) framework to address the issue of Large Language Model (LLM) overfitting to benchmark-specific surface cues, rather than demonstrating true language understanding. C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts (using the MMLU dataset as an example) through rephrasing, while preserving semantic content and labels. By comparing performance on original versus perturbed prompts and using statistical validation (McNemar's test), C-BOD detects whether LLMs rely on memorized patterns. Experiments with 26 LLMs revealed that most models exhibit a performance degradation under these perturbations, indicating widespread overfitting. Notably, a positive correlation was found between model size and performance degradation, suggesting larger models are more sensitive to rephrasing. Similarly, models with higher baseline accuracy also showed greater performance drops, highlighting a paradox where top performers may be overfit. The Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy demonstrated more robustness. The framework is dataset-agnostic and its code is publicly released for reproducibility. Limitations include potential oversight of deeper forms of overfitting and the computational cost of integration into training pipelines.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The C-BOD framework detects LLM overfitting by rephrasing benchmark prompts, revealing reliance on surface cues rather than true understanding.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more susceptible to performance degradation when prompts are perturbed, indicating a correlation between size/accuracy and overfitting.\n*   The Llama family of models and those with lower initial accuracy showed greater robustness to prompt rephrasing.\n*   The study found that 20 out of 26 evaluated LLMs exhibited statistically significant performance drops under modest prompt perturbations, highlighting the prevalence of overfitting.\n*   The C-BOD framework is dataset-agnostic, and its code and datasets are publicly released to promote reproducible and more robust LLM evaluation.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to uncover LLM overfitting to benchmark-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts while preserving semantic content and labels, allowing for the detection of dependency on memorized patterns. Applied to the MMLU benchmark across 26 LLMs, C-BOD revealed an average performance degradation of 2.15% under modest rephrasing, with 20 models showing statistically significant drops. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy exhibited greater performance degradation, suggesting a reliance on fixed prompt patterns. In contrast, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy demonstrated less degradation, indicating reduced dependency on superficial cues. The framework's dataset- and model-agnostic design facilitates integration into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding, challenging the community to prioritize resilience over leaderboard scores.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD is a meta-evaluation framework that detects LLM overfitting by rephrasing benchmark prompts, revealing reliance on surface cues.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy are more prone to performance degradation when prompts are rephrased, indicating a potential overreliance on specific phrasing.\n*   The Llama family of models demonstrated greater robustness to prompt perturbations compared to other architectural families, exhibiting less performance degradation.\n*   C-BOD's findings challenge the reliance on high benchmark scores, highlighting that they may mask underlying vulnerabilities to prompt variations.\n*   While effective for surface-level overfitting, C-BOD has limitations in detecting deeper forms of overfitting and can be computationally intensive for training integration.",
