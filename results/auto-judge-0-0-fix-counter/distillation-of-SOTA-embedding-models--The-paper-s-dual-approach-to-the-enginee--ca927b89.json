SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces a novel multi-stage distillation framework for creating efficient text embedding models, addressing the challenge of high dimensionality and parameter count in state-of-the-art models. The core of their approach involves a \"dual approach\" to embedding dimensionality: first, a multi-stage distillation process where a smaller student model (Jasper) learns from multiple larger teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella). This distillation is guided by three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss, which progressively align the student's representations with the teachers'. Second, to tackle the resulting high dimensionality from concatenating teacher outputs, they integrate Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). This technique uses additional fully connected layers to effectively compress the student model's vector representations into lower dimensions, making them more practical for real-world applications. The resulting Jasper model, with 2 billion parameters, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of this dual strategy for both knowledge transfer and dimensionality reduction.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper proposes a multi-stage distillation framework to transfer knowledge from multiple large teacher embedding models to a smaller student model.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model.\n*   The framework utilizes three distinct loss functions (cosine loss, similarity loss, relative similarity distillation loss) to guide the distillation process.\n*   The resulting Jasper model (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to larger 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, showcasing the effectiveness of the dual approach to dimensionality.",

The core of this framework involves distilling knowledge from multiple larger teacher embedding models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5) using three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (Lcosine) for direct representation alignment, similarity loss (Lsim) for pairwise semantic consistency, and relative similarity distillation loss (Lresim) for preserving ranking preferences. Stages 1 and 2 focus on this distillation, with Stage 2 further fine-tuning the student model's encoder layers. To address the challenge of high dimensionality often associated with powerful embedding models, Stage 3 utilizes Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers to effectively reduce vector dimensionality while maintaining performance. Stage 4 explores multimodal capabilities by aligning visual embeddings with textual ones using self-distillation. Jasper's architecture combines a language model and a vision encoder, with FC layers for projection. The model achieved the No. 3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating performance comparable to 7B parameter models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a four-stage distillation process using Lcosine, Lsim, and Lresim losses to learn from multiple large teacher models.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is used in Stage 3 for effective vector dimensionality reduction.\n*   Jasper, a 2B parameter model, achieved comparable performance to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, securing the No. 3 position.\n*   The model architecture integrates language and vision encoders, with fully connected layers for embedding projection and dimensionality adjustment.\n*   Stage 4 introduces self-distillation for preliminary multimodal alignment, with potential for future enhancements.",

The core of their solution lies in a multi-stage distillation framework designed to transfer knowledge from multiple larger teacher models to a smaller student model. This process utilizes three carefully crafted loss functions: cosine loss (Lcosine) for aligning absolute representations, similarity loss (Lsim) for consistent semantic judgment, and relative similarity distillation loss (Lresim) for preserving ranking preferences. Following the distillation stages (1 & 2), Stage 3 employs Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to effectively reduce vector dimensionality, allowing for more efficient deployment. Stage 4 further enhances the model by unlocking multimodal potential through self-distillation, aligning visual and textual embeddings. The resulting Jasper model, with 2 billion parameters, achieves performance comparable to 7 billion parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of their dual approach to distillation and dimension reduction.\n\n2.

The first approach involves a multi-stage knowledge distillation framework where a smaller student model learns from multiple larger teacher models. This distillation process utilizes three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. These losses progressively capture broader semantic relationships, moving from individual text representations to pairwise and relative ranking information. The second approach focuses on reducing vector dimensionality using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). In Stage 3, after concatenating teacher vectors to create a high-dimensional student representation (12288 dimensions), MRL is applied through additional fully connected layers to generate lower-dimensional outputs (e.g., 512 dimensions). Notably, the cosine loss is omitted in Stage 3 for these reduced dimensions, relying solely on similarity and relative similarity losses, while the 12288-dimensional vectors continue to be trained with all three losses.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper employs a multi-stage distillation process using cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss to transfer knowledge from larger teacher models to a smaller student model.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized in Stage 3 to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model.\n*   Teacher model dimensions (e.g., 4096 and 8192) are concatenated, leading to an initial high-dimensional student vector of 12288 dimensions before reduction.\n*   Cosine loss is omitted for the reduced-dimensionality vectors in Stage 3, with only similarity and relative similarity losses being used, while the full-dimensional vectors retain all three losses.\n*   Stage 2 trains the last three encoder layers along with a fully connected layer, whereas Stage 3 focuses on dimension reduction using additional fully connected layers and trains all student model parameters.",

SUMMARY:\nThe paper presents Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, which addresses the challenge of deploying large, high-dimensionality state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding models in real-world applications. Their dual approach involves a multi-stage distillation framework and Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for dimension reduction. The distillation process utilizes three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss, to transfer knowledge from multiple larger teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5) to a smaller student model. This multi-stage distillation occurs over four stages: the first two focus on distilling knowledge using the three loss functions, with varying parameters being trained. Stage three employs MRL via additional fully connected layers to reduce the vector dimensionality, using only similarity-based losses. Stage four introduces a preliminary multimodal capability by aligning image embeddings with text embeddings through self-distillation. This comprehensive approach allows Jasper to achieve performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, while being significantly more efficient.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a four-stage distillation process, leveraging three specific loss functions (cosine, similarity, relative similarity) to transfer knowledge from larger teacher models.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized in Stage 3 to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model.\n*   Stage 4 introduces a preliminary multimodal alignment between image and text embeddings using self-distillation.\n*   Jasper, with 2 billion parameters, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, demonstrating an effective dual approach to embedding dimensionality.\n*   The implementation details highlight specific teacher models, hyperparameters, and training configurations for each stage.",

The core of their approach addresses the engineering challenge of embedding dimensionality through a dual strategy. First, a multi-stage distillation process distills knowledge from multiple larger, high-performing teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella) into the student model. This distillation utilizes three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss for aligning absolute representations, similarity loss for semantic matching, and relative similarity distillation loss for capturing ranking preferences. Second, to combat the high dimensionality that arises from concatenating teacher embeddings, they integrate Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). This allows for effective compression of the student model's vector representations into smaller, more manageable dimensions (e.g., 512). Stage 4 further enhances Jasper by incorporating a self-distillation mechanism to align its visual encoder with textual embeddings, unlocking multimodal capabilities. The resulting Jasper model achieves a high average score on the MTEB leaderboard, comparable to models with significantly more parameters, demonstrating the effectiveness of their dual approach to knowledge distillation and dimensionality reduction.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a multi-stage distillation framework with cosine, similarity, and relative similarity loss functions to learn from multiple teacher models.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized for effective compression of the student model's vector dimensionality.\n*   The model achieves top-tier performance on the MTEB leaderboard with 2B parameters, comparable to 7B models.\n*   Stage 4 integrates self-distillation for multimodal capabilities, aligning visual and textual embeddings.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model that achieves competitive performance with larger 7B models by employing a novel multi-stage distillation framework. The dual approach to the engineering problem of embedding dimensionality reduction involves knowledge distillation from multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models and Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). The distillation process utilizes three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (Lcosine) for aligning absolute representations, similarity loss (Lsim) for preserving semantic consistency between text pairs, and relative similarity distillation loss (Lresim) for learning ranking preferences. The multi-stage training begins with distilling from two large teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella_en_1.5B_v5) using these losses, progressively training more parameters. Stage 3 then applies MRL with additional fully connected layers to reduce the high dimensionality (initially 12,288) to more manageable sizes like 512, using Lsim and Lresim. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential by aligning image embeddings with text embeddings through a self-distillation process. The Jasper model, built upon Stella, achieves the No.3 position on the MTEB leaderboard.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art performance comparable to 7 billion parameter models on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). The core of their approach is a novel multi-stage distillation framework designed to address the challenges of high dimensionality and numerous parameters in leading embedding models. Stages 1 and 2 focus on distilling knowledge from multiple large teacher models (NV-Embed-v2 and Stella) using three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (Lcosine) for aligning absolute representations, similarity loss (Lsim) for capturing semantic discrepancies, and relative similarity distillation loss (Lresim) for preserving ranking preferences. Stage 3 employs Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) with additional fully connected layers to effectively reduce vector dimensionality. Stage 4 explores multimodal capabilities by aligning visual embeddings with textual embeddings through self-distillation. The Jasper model, built upon Stella, achieved a No. 3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of this dual approach to embedding dimensionality.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper utilizes a multi-stage distillation framework to learn from multiple large teacher models, achieving comparable performance to 7B models with only 2B parameters.\n*   The distillation process employs three loss functions: Lcosine (absolute representation alignment), Lsim (semantic pair similarity), and Lresim (relative ranking preservation).\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is used in Stage 3 to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model.\n*   Jasper achieved a No. 3 ranking on the MTEB leaderboard, showcasing the effectiveness of its distillation and dimension reduction strategies.\n*   Stage 4 introduces preliminary multimodal alignment, indicating potential for future enhancements in cross-modal capabilities.",

The core strategy involves a multi-stage distillation framework to transfer knowledge from larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models to a smaller student model. Stages 1 and 2 focus on this distillation using three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (Lcosine) for aligning absolute representations, similarity loss (Lsim) for consistent semantic judgment between text pairs, and relative similarity distillation loss (Lresim) for preserving ranking preferences.

The core strategy involves a multi-stage distillation framework to transfer knowledge from larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models to a smaller student model. Stages 1 and 2 focus on this distillation using three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (Lcosine) for aligning absolute representations, similarity loss (Lsim) for consistent semantic judgment between text pairs, and relative similarity distillation loss (Lresim) for preserving ranking preferences. Stage 3 tackles dimension reduction by incorporating Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) and fully connected layers to create lower-dimensional vectors. Stage 4 aims to unlock multimodal potential by aligning visual and textual embeddings. Jasper, built on Stella, achieved the No. 3 position on the MTEB leaderboard with a 2B parameter model, demonstrating performance comparable to 7B parameter models.\n\n2.
