The researchers introduce the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD) framework, which systematically distorts benchmark prompts to reveal LLMs' reliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. Their experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 leading LLMs show a significant performance degradation of 2.15% on average when prompts are rephrased. Notably, larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to these rephrasings, indicating a greater propensity for overfitting to fixed prompt patterns. Conversely, models with lower baseline accuracy, like the Llama family, exhibit less degradation, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues. The findings challenge the community to prioritize resilience and generalization over leaderboard scores, highlighting that larger models, despite higher base accuracy, may be more susceptible to overfitting due to their scale.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to prompt rephrasing, indicating increased overfitting vulnerability with scale.\n*   Models with higher baseline accuracy on standard benchmarks often show larger performance drops when prompts are perturbed, suggesting they rely on surface cues.\n*   The Llama family of models, and those with lower baseline accuracy, demonstrated reduced performance degradation under rephrasing, implying less overfitting.\n*   An average performance drop of 2.15% was observed across 26 LLMs when exposed to modest prompt perturbations, with 20 models showing statistically significant declines.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD) framework to assess how Large Language Models (LLMs) overfit to specific prompt patterns in benchmark evaluations. C-BOD systematically rephrases benchmark prompts while preserving semantic meaning and labels, then measures performance degradation. The study found that 20 out of 26 leading LLMs exhibited statistically significant performance drops on rephrased prompts, averaging a 2.15% accuracy decrease. Notably, larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy were more susceptible to overfitting, showing greater performance degradation. In contrast, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy demonstrated reduced dependency on superficial cues. C-BOD's dataset and model-agnostic design allows for integration into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding, challenging the community to look beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize resilience. While effective for surface-level overfitting, C-BOD has limitations regarding deeper forms of overfitting and potential high computational costs for mitigation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more vulnerable to overfitting on benchmark-specific prompt patterns, exhibiting greater performance degradation when prompts are rephrased.\n*   The C-BOD framework revealed that 20 out of 26 evaluated LLMs showed statistically significant performance drops (averaging 2.15%) on rephrased prompts, indicating a reliance on superficial cues.\n*   The Llama family of models, along with those with lower initial accuracy, demonstrated greater robustness and reduced dependency on superficial prompt features.\n*   C-BOD is a meta-evaluation framework that systematically distorts benchmark prompts to detect overfitting, aiming to promote more resilient and generalizable LLM performance beyond surface-level accuracy.\n*   A key limitation of C-BOD is its primary focus on textual rephrasing, potentially overlooking deeper forms of overfitting, and the significant computational cost associated with integrating its mitigation strategies into training pipelines.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a framework designed to expose LLMs' overreliance on benchmark-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. By systematically rephrasing benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic content, C-BOD measures performance degradation. Their findings reveal that many LLMs, particularly larger ones, exhibit a significant drop in accuracy when faced with these rephrased prompts, indicating a tendency to overfit. The study found a positive correlation between model size and performance degradation, suggesting larger models are more susceptible. Conversely, models with lower baseline accuracy, like the Llama family, demonstrated greater resilience to these perturbations, performing consistently across original and rephrased inputs. The research challenges the community to move beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize robustness and generalization in LLM evaluations. While C-BOD is effective at detecting surface-level overfitting, its limitations include potential oversight of deeper overfitting forms and the computational cost of integrating it into training pipelines.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Larger LLMs tend to be more vulnerable to overfitting on benchmark-specific phrasing, showing greater performance degradation when prompts are rephrased.\n*   Models with higher baseline accuracy on standard benchmarks are more likely to experience significant performance drops when exposed to prompt variations, suggesting a reliance on superficial cues.\n*   The Llama family of models, along with those exhibiting lower baseline accuracy, demonstrated greater resilience to prompt rephrasing, indicating reduced dependency on superficial patterns.\n*   C-BOD effectively identifies overfitting by quantifying performance differences on semantically equivalent but textually altered prompts, highlighting a gap in current LLM evaluation practices.\n*   While effective for surface-level overfitting, C-BOD may not capture deeper forms of overfitting and can be computationally intensive to integrate into training.",

The authors introduce the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework that systematically rephrases benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic content. By evaluating LLMs on both original and rephrased prompts, C-BOD detects over-reliance on dataset-specific surface cues. Their findings on the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs reveal that larger models tend to be more sensitive to these rephrasings, exhibiting greater performance degradation. This suggests that increased scale, while often associated with higher baseline accuracy, can also correlate with a heightened tendency to overfit to prompt patterns. Models with higher baseline accuracy also showed larger performance drops, indicating that exceptional performance on standard benchmarks might mask underlying vulnerabilities. Conversely, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy demonstrated more resilience, with less significant performance degradation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Larger LLMs tend to be more vulnerable to overfitting on benchmark prompts, showing greater performance degradation when prompts are rephrased.\n*   Models with higher baseline accuracy on standard benchmarks are also more prone to performance drops when faced with prompt variations, suggesting their high scores might be due to memorization of surface cues.\n*   The Llama family of models, along with those with lower baseline accuracy, exhibit greater resilience to prompt rephrasing, indicating reduced dependency on superficial patterns.\n*   C-BOD, a new meta-evaluation framework, systematically rephrases prompts to detect overfitting by measuring performance degradation.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the impact of model scale on overfitting vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD). C-BOD systematically distorts benchmark prompts while preserving semantic content to expose LLMs' reliance on dataset-specific surface cues. Across 26 leading LLMs evaluated on the MMLU benchmark, an average performance degradation of 2.15% was observed under modest rephrasing, with 20 models showing statistically significant drops. Notably, larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to these perturbations, indicating a greater susceptibility to overfitting. Models with higher baseline accuracy also exhibited larger performance differences, suggesting that exceptional performance on standard benchmarks may mask an overreliance on fixed prompt patterns. Conversely, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy demonstrated less degradation, implying reduced dependency on superficial cues. This research challenges the community to prioritize resilience and generalization over leaderboard scores.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Larger LLMs tend to be more vulnerable to overfitting, showing greater performance degradation when benchmark prompts are rephrased.\n*   Models with higher baseline accuracy on standard benchmarks are more likely to experience significant performance drops when faced with prompt perturbations, indicating an overreliance on superficial cues.\n*   On average, LLMs experienced a 2.15% performance degradation when prompts were slightly altered, with 20 out of 26 models showing statistically significant drops.\n*   The Llama family of models, along with those exhibiting lower initial accuracy, demonstrated greater resilience to prompt rephrasing, suggesting reduced overfitting.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD) framework to assess how much Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. C-BOD works by systematically rephrasing benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic meaning and labels, then observing performance degradation. When tested on the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs, C-BOD revealed that most models (20 out of 26) showed a statistically significant performance drop when faced with these rephrased prompts, averaging 2.15%. Notably, the study found that larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more vulnerable to overfitting. In contrast, models like the Llama family and those with lower initial accuracy demonstrated greater resilience to these textual perturbations, suggesting a reduced dependency on superficial patterns. The findings challenge the LLM evaluation community to look beyond standard leaderboard scores and prioritize robustness and generalization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy are more susceptible to overfitting to benchmark-specific phrasing.\n*   The C-BOD framework, which rephrases prompts while preserving meaning, detected significant performance degradation in 20 out of 26 LLMs.\n*   The Llama family of models and those with lower initial accuracy showed greater resilience, indicating less reliance on superficial cues.\n*   The average performance drop across all models due to rephrasing was 2.15%, highlighting widespread overfitting to prompt formats.\n*   The research advocates for evaluations that prioritize model resilience and generalization over raw benchmark scores.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD) framework to assess how LLMs overfit to specific benchmark prompts, rather than truly understanding language. C-BOD systematically rephrases benchmark questions while preserving their meaning and labels to detect reliance on surface cues. Evaluating 26 leading LLMs on the MMLU benchmark, the study found that most models (20 out of 26) exhibited a significant performance drop (average 2.15%) when faced with these rephrased prompts, indicating overfitting. A key finding is the correlation between model scale and overfitting vulnerability: larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to rephrasing and thus more prone to this type of overfitting. Conversely, models with lower baseline accuracy or those from the Llama family showed less degradation, suggesting greater robustness. The research challenges the community to move beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize evaluating LLMs for resilience and generalization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Larger LLMs are more vulnerable to overfitting to specific benchmark prompt patterns, showing greater performance degradation when prompts are rephrased.\n*   Models with higher baseline accuracy on standard benchmarks are also more likely to experience significant performance drops when presented with rephrased prompts, suggesting a reliance on superficial cues.\n*   The Llama family of models and those with lower baseline accuracy demonstrated more resilience to prompt rephrasing, indicating reduced dependency on superficial patterns.\n*   The C-BOD framework, by systematically distorting prompts, revealed that a significant portion of LLMs' high benchmark scores may be due to memorizing specific wording rather than true language understanding.\n*   The study advocates for evaluations that prioritize LLM resilience and generalization over raw benchmark performance.",

By systematically rephrasing benchmark questions while preserving their meaning, C-BOD reveals if high performance is due to memorization of surface cues rather than true understanding. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 leading LLMs showed that most models experienced a performance degradation of over 2% after rephrasing, with 20 models exhibiting statistically significant drops. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy were found to be more vulnerable to these perturbations, indicating a stronger reliance on fixed prompt patterns. In contrast, the Llama family of models demonstrated greater resilience, with less performance degradation. The study highlights a paradox where top-performing models on standard benchmarks may be overfit to dataset-specific cues. C-BOD's agnostic design allows integration into training to promote more robust language understanding, urging a shift in evaluation focus beyond leaderboard scores.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher baseline accuracy are more susceptible to overfitting on benchmark-specific surface cues, showing greater performance degradation when prompts are rephrased.\n*   The C-BOD framework systematically distorts benchmark prompts to detect overfitting, revealing that many LLMs rely on memorized patterns rather than true language understanding.\n*   The Llama family of models demonstrated notable resilience to prompt rephrasing, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues compared to other models.\n*   An average performance drop of 2.15% was observed across 26 LLMs when tested on rephrased prompts, with 20 models showing statistically significant declines.\n*   The research challenges the LLM community to prioritize resilience and generalization in evaluations over solely relying on leaderboard scores.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD) framework to assess how susceptible Large Language Models (LLMs) are to overfitting on benchmark datasets. The core idea is to systematically rephrase benchmark prompts while preserving their semantic meaning and correct answers. By comparing performance on original versus rephrased prompts, C-BOD can detect if an LLM's high scores are due to memorizing specific prompt patterns rather than genuine understanding. The study found that a significant number of LLMs (20 out of 26 evaluated) exhibit performance degradation when faced with these rephrased prompts, indicating a widespread issue of overfitting. Notably, larger models and models with higher baseline accuracy tend to be more vulnerable to these perturbations, suggesting that increased scale and strong performance on standard benchmarks can sometimes mask an overreliance on superficial cues. In contrast, the Llama family of models demonstrated greater resilience, showing minimal performance drops. The paper emphasizes the need to look beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize robustness in LLM evaluation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The C-BOD framework detects LLM overfitting by rephrasing benchmark prompts and measuring performance degradation.\n*   Larger LLMs and those with higher initial accuracy are more prone to performance drops when prompts are rephrased, indicating a potential reliance on surface-level cues.\n*   The Llama family of models showed notable resilience to prompt rephrasing, suggesting less overfitting to benchmark-specific patterns.\n*   The research highlights that high benchmark scores may not always reflect true generalization but could be a result of memorizing prompt formats.\n*   C-BOD aims to encourage more robust evaluation practices that prioritize generalization over superficial performance.",

C-BOD systematically rephrases benchmark questions while preserving their semantic meaning, then evaluates model performance on both original and rephrased versions. Their experimental validation on 26 leading LLMs revealed that most models experience a performance degradation when faced with these rephrased prompts, indicating a reliance on surface cues rather than true language understanding. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy showed a greater tendency for performance decline under these perturbations. Conversely, the Llama family of models demonstrated more resilience, exhibiting minimal degradation. The findings suggest that high scores on standard benchmarks may mask vulnerabilities, and emphasize the need for more robust evaluation methods that prioritize generalization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The C-BOD framework detects LLM overfitting by rephrasing benchmark prompts and measuring performance degradation, revealing a reliance on surface-level cues.\n*   Larger LLMs and models with higher initial accuracy tend to be more vulnerable to performance drops when prompts are rephrased, indicating potential overfitting.\n*   The Llama family of models showed significant resilience to prompt rephrasing, suggesting a reduced dependency on superficial patterns.\n*   Experimental validation on 26 LLMs confirmed that a majority experienced statistically significant performance declines on rephrased prompts, highlighting a widespread issue in LLM evaluation.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD) framework to assess how LLMs overfit to specific prompt patterns in benchmarks like MMLU. C-BOD systematically rephrases benchmark questions while preserving their semantic meaning, then evaluates model performance on both original and rephrased versions. Their experimental validation on 26 leading LLMs revealed that most models experience a performance degradation when faced with these rephrased prompts, indicating a reliance on surface cues rather than true language understanding. Notably, larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy showed a greater tendency for performance decline under these perturbations. Conversely, the Llama family of models demonstrated more resilience, exhibiting minimal degradation. The findings suggest that high scores on standard benchmarks may mask vulnerabilities, and emphasize the need for more robust evaluation methods that prioritize generalization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The C-BOD framework detects LLM overfitting by rephrasing benchmark prompts and measuring performance degradation, revealing a reliance on surface-level cues.\n*   Larger LLMs and models with higher initial accuracy tend to be more vulnerable to performance drops when prompts are rephrased, indicating potential overfitting.\n*   The Llama family of models showed significant resilience to prompt rephrasing, suggesting a reduced dependency on superficial patterns.\n*   Experimental validation on 26 LLMs confirmed that a majority experienced statistically significant performance declines on rephrased prompts, highlighting a widespread issue in LLM evaluation.",
