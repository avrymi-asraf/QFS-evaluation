SUMMARY:\nThis research critically examines the conclusions drawn in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) studies, particularly when these studies rely heavily on the Qwen model family. The paper demonstrates that Qwen models, especially Qwen2.5-Math, are exceptionally susceptible to performance gains from \"spurious\" reward signals. These signals, such as random rewards, incorrect labels, or even format-based rewards, can boost Qwen's performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks like MATH-500 by substantial margins, often approaching gains seen with ground truth rewards. Crucially, these same spurious rewards fail to yield similar improvements in other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, indicating that the observed gains are not a general property of RLVR but rather a model-specific phenomenon. The study hypothesizes that RLVR in Qwen models primarily surfaces and amplifies pre-existing reasoning capabilities, such as \"code reasoning\" (using Python for mathematical thought without execution), which is prevalent in Qwen but not in other models. This suggests that RLVR research conclusions should be validated across diverse models to avoid model-specific artifacts masking the true efficacy of training signals.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, achieve significant performance gains in RLVR even with completely spurious or uninformative reward signals (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format).\n*   These performance improvements from spurious rewards are model-specific and do not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2.\n*   RLVR in Qwen models appears to primarily elicit and amplify pre-existing reasoning strategies, such as \"code reasoning\" (using Python for mathematical thought), which is a distinct behavior of Qwen.\n*   The findings highlight a critical need to validate RLVR research conclusions across a diverse range of models, not just Qwen, to avoid drawing misleading inferences about the robustness of RLVR techniques.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research critically examines the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) by demonstrating how easily performance gains can be achieved with spurious reward signals, particularly in the Qwen model family. The study reveals that Qwen models, especially Qwen2.5-Math, exhibit substantial improvements on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (like MATH-500) even when trained with rewards that are random, incorrect, or merely based on output formatting. These gains often rival those from using ground truth rewards. A key finding is that this phenomenon is not generalizable to other model families such as Llama3 or OLMo2, which show minimal or no improvement with spurious rewards. The research posits that Qwen models' pre-training likely imbues them with specific reasoning strategies, such as \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for mathematical thought processes), which RLVR can effectively amplify, even with flawed reward signals. This highlights a critical need to validate RLVR findings across diverse model architectures to avoid spurious conclusions driven by model-specific behaviors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, achieve significant performance gains in RLVR with spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format), often matching ground truth reward performance.\n*   These gains are highly model-specific; spurious rewards fail to improve other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, indicating reliance on pre-existing model behaviors.\n*   Qwen models exhibit \"code reasoning\" (using Python for mathematical thought without execution), a strategy that RLVR effectively amplifies, leading to performance boosts even with uninformative rewards.\n*   The findings suggest that RLVR may primarily surface latent capabilities from pre-training rather than teaching new ones, making model selection crucial for reproducible research.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse models, not just Qwen, to avoid drawing conclusions based on spurious reward elicitation.",

SUMMARY:\n\nThis research critically examines the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and reveals a significant issue: performance gains can be easily achieved in certain models, particularly the Qwen family, using \"spurious\" reward signals that are unrelated or even negatively correlated with the correct answer. Experiments show that Qwen2.5-Math models, when trained with rewards based on incorrect labels, formatting, or even random signals, exhibit substantial improvements on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, often rivaling gains from ground truth rewards. This effect is highly model-specific, as these spurious rewards fail to yield similar benefits for other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, suggesting that RLVR primarily amplifies pre-existing capabilities. The study identifies \"code reasoning\"—the use of Python code within generated solutions without actual execution—as a key pre-training behavior in Qwen models that RLVR effectively leverages, even with flawed rewards. The findings underscore the critical need for validating RLVR research across diverse model architectures to avoid misleading conclusions drawn from model-specific sensitivities to spurious signals.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n*   **Spurious Rewards Drive Performance Gains in Qwen:** Qwen2.5-Math models achieve significant performance improvements in RLVR even with rewards that are incorrect, poorly correlated, or random, highlighting the ease of generating spurious gains.\n*   **Model-Specific Generalization:** The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; signals that boost Qwen models often fail to improve other families like Llama3 or OLMo2, indicating RLVR amplifies pre-training specific behaviors.\n*   **Code Reasoning as a Key Elicited Behavior:** Qwen models exhibit a strong pre-existing tendency for \"code reasoning,\" which RLVR effectively upweights, leading to performance gains even with non-informative reward signals.\n*   **Call for Diverse Validation:** The research strongly advocates for validating RLVR findings across a broad range of models, not just Qwen, to avoid drawing conclusions based on model-specific sensitivities to spurious training signals.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research critically examines the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its susceptibility to \"spurious rewards\"—signals that are weakly or negatively correlated with correct answers. The study highlights that the Qwen model family, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, exhibits an unusual robustness to these spurious signals. For instance, Qwen models achieve substantial performance gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (like MATH-500) even when trained with random, incorrect label, or format-based rewards. These gains often approach those achieved with ground truth rewards. Crucially, this phenomenon is not universal; other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2 show minimal or no improvement with spurious rewards, indicating that pretraining differences play a significant role. The research posits that RLVR, especially with spurious rewards, primarily elicits and amplifies pre-existing reasoning strategies within models. For Qwen2.5-Math, this often manifests as \"code reasoning\"—using Python code within explanations without actual execution—which strongly correlates with improved accuracy. The paper strongly advocates for validating RLVR research across diverse model families, not just Qwen, to avoid drawing conclusions based on model-specific sensitivities to such spurious signals.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, show significant performance gains from RLVR even with spurious rewards (random, incorrect labels, format), often matching ground truth reward performance.\n*   This sensitivity to spurious rewards is model-specific; Llama3 and OLMo2 models do not benefit similarly, suggesting pretraining differences are key.\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards appears to elicit and amplify pre-existing reasoning strategies, such as \"code reasoning\" in Qwen models, which correlates with improved accuracy.\n*   The study emphasizes the critical need for validating RLVR research across diverse model families to prevent conclusions biased by model-specific behaviors.\n*   Various types of spurious rewards, including random, incorrect label, and format-based rewards, were tested and found to elicit gains in Qwen models.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research critically examines the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its susceptibility to spurious reward signals, using the Qwen model family as a case study. The study reveals that Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, can achieve significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning tasks (e.g., MATH-500) even when trained with rewards that are unrelated or even negatively correlated with correctness (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, or format-based rewards). These gains are often comparable to those achieved with ground truth rewards. Crucially, these spurious rewards are largely ineffective on other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, highlighting a strong dependency on the model's pretraining data and inherent capabilities. For Qwen models, RLVR appears to amplify existing reasoning strategies, such as \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid reasoning without execution), which strongly correlates with improved performance. This suggests that RLVR, in many cases, surfaces latent abilities rather than teaching new ones. The findings underscore the need for broader model validation in RLVR research to avoid drawing conclusions based on model-specific artifacts.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen models, especially Qwen2.5-Math, achieve substantial performance gains in RLVR using spurious rewards (random, incorrect labels, format) that are comparable to ground truth rewards.\n*   These spurious rewards are largely ineffective on other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, indicating a strong model-specific dependence, likely due to differences in pretraining.\n*   RLVR, particularly with spurious rewards, tends to elicit and amplify pre-existing reasoning strategies within models, such as \"code reasoning\" in Qwen, which correlates with improved performance.\n*   The research cautions against model-specific conclusions in RLVR, emphasizing the necessity of validating findings across diverse model architectures and pretraining distributions.\n*   Various spurious reward types were tested, including majority vote, format, random, and incorrect label rewards, all demonstrating the potential to elicit performance gains in Qwen models.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its susceptibility to spurious reward signals, using the Qwen model family as a case study. The research demonstrates that Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, can achieve significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning tasks even with rewards that are irrelevant or incorrect. For instance, spurious rewards like random noise, incorrect labels, or simply formatting cues led to substantial accuracy improvements on benchmarks like MATH-500, often rivaling gains from ground truth rewards. Crucially, these spurious rewards were found to be highly model-specific, failing to produce similar improvements in other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2. The study hypothesizes that RLVR, especially with spurious rewards, primarily elicits and amplifies pre-existing reasoning capabilities within the base model, rather than teaching new ones. A key observed behavior in Qwen models is \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for mathematical thought), which RLVR strongly upweights, leading to performance boosts. The paper concludes by recommending that future RLVR research be validated across diverse model architectures to avoid drawing conclusions based on model-specific artifacts, as the effectiveness of spurious signals is easily demonstrated on Qwen models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, exhibit substantial performance gains in RLVR even with spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format-based), often matching ground truth reward performance.\n*   The effectiveness of these spurious rewards is highly model-specific, with similar techniques failing to yield gains on other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2.\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards appears to work by amplifying pre-existing reasoning strategies within the base model, such as \"code reasoning\" in Qwen models, which correlates with improved accuracy.\n*   The research cautions against drawing conclusions solely from Qwen model experiments, as spurious signals can easily inflate performance metrics, and advocates for cross-model validation in future RLVR research.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for mathematical reasoning, focusing on how easily performance gains can be achieved with spurious or weak reward signals, particularly in Qwen models. The research demonstrates that Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit significant performance improvements on benchmarks like MATH-500 and AMC even when trained with rewards that are random, incorrect, or merely based on output formatting. These gains, sometimes approaching those from ground truth rewards, highlight a potential issue in RLVR research: conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models might be misleading. The study finds that these spurious rewards often fail to generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, suggesting that RLVR might be eliciting pre-existing, model-specific reasoning abilities rather than teaching new ones. The paper identifies \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for mathematical thought processes) as a key behavior in Qwen models that RLVR amplifies, even with spurious rewards. This highlights the importance of validating RLVR findings across diverse model architectures to avoid overstating the impact of specific reward signals.\n\n2.

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) in improving mathematical reasoning, particularly focusing on the Qwen model family. Counterintuitively, the study demonstrates that Qwen models, such as Qwen2.5-Math-7B, achieve significant performance gains on benchmarks like MATH-500 even with \"spurious\" rewards (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, or format adherence) that have little or no correlation with the correct answer. These gains can even rival those achieved with ground truth rewards. A key observation is that these spurious rewards are largely ineffective on other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, suggesting that Qwen models possess unique pre-trained reasoning capabilities, specifically \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for problem-solving without execution), which RLVR can effectively elicit. The paper hypothesizes that RLVR, especially with spurious signals, primarily surfaces and amplifies these latent, pre-trained reasoning strategies rather than teaching new ones. This reliance on pre-trained behaviors highlights a critical need for cross-model validation in RLVR research, as conclusions drawn from Qwen models may not generalize, and spurious signals can easily lead to misleading performance improvements.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen models (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-7B) achieve substantial performance gains in mathematical reasoning using RLVR with spurious rewards like random or incorrect labels, sometimes matching ground truth rewards.\n*   These spurious rewards are largely ineffective on other model families (Llama3, OLMo2), indicating Qwen's unique pre-trained reasoning abilities, particularly \"code reasoning,\" are being exploited by RLVR.\n*   The study suggests RLVR primarily amplifies existing, latent reasoning strategies rather than teaching new ones, especially when using spurious reward signals.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, underscoring the importance of validating RLVR research across diverse model architectures and pre-training distributions.\n*   The paper cautions that significant performance improvements on Qwen models can be easily achieved with non-informative or even misleading reward signals, potentially leading to spurious conclusions in RLVR research.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and highlights a critical issue: the Qwen model family, particularly its math-specialized variants, exhibits significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning tasks even when trained with entirely spurious or weak reward signals. These gains, achieved with rewards based on incorrect labels, formatting, or even random assignments, can rival those obtained with ground truth rewards, demonstrating that RLVR can easily exploit pre-trained latent abilities. A key finding is that Qwen models frequently employ \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code without execution) as a strategy, which correlates strongly with improved performance. RLVR, especially with spurious rewards, appears to amplify this pre-existing code reasoning behavior in Qwen models. Crucially, these positive effects of spurious rewards do not generalize to other model families like Llama or OLMo, which show minimal or no improvement, underscoring the importance of cross-model validation in RLVR research to avoid drawing model-specific conclusions based on easily manipulated signals.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen models, especially Qwen2.5-Math, achieve substantial performance improvements in mathematical reasoning with spurious reward signals (e.g., incorrect labels, random rewards), often approaching gains from ground truth rewards.\n*   The effectiveness of these spurious rewards is highly model-specific; they work well for Qwen models but fail to generalize to families like Llama or OLMo.\n*   Qwen models exhibit a strong tendency towards \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code), a behavior that RLVR, even with spurious signals, significantly amplifies and which correlates with higher accuracy.\n*   The research suggests that RLVR primarily elicits and upweights pre-existing reasoning strategies learned during pretraining, rather than teaching entirely new capabilities, making Qwen models particularly susceptible to spurious rewards due to their pre-trained code reasoning abilities.\n*   The findings strongly advocate for validating RLVR research across diverse model families to avoid drawing conclusions that are only applicable to specific models like Qwen.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research critically examines the efficacy of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its susceptibility to spurious reward signals, using the Qwen model family as a case study. The study reveals that Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, achieve significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning tasks even when trained with rewards that are unrelated or even contradictory to the correct answers. For instance, rewards based on incorrect labels, random signals, or mere output formatting can boost Qwen2.5-Math performance by substantial margins, sometimes rivaling gains from ground truth rewards. Crucially, these spurious rewards do not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, highlighting that Qwen's unique pre-training, particularly its \"code reasoning\" capability (using Python for thought processes without execution), is key to this susceptibility. The paper argues that RLVR often amplifies existing, latent reasoning abilities rather than teaching new ones, and that conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models may be misleading due to this model-specific sensitivity to weak or spurious signals. The authors strongly recommend validating RLVR research across diverse model architectures to ensure generalizability and avoid spurious correlations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen models, especially Qwen2.5-Math, show substantial performance gains in RLVR even with spurious rewards (e.g., incorrect labels, random signals, format rewards), sometimes matching ground truth reward performance.\n*   These gains from spurious rewards are highly model-specific and do not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math's pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capability (generating Python for problem-solving) is identified as a key factor enabling spurious rewards to elicit performance improvements.\n*   RLVR appears to amplify latent reasoning abilities present in the base model, rather than teaching novel skills, especially when using spurious rewards.\n*   The study advocates for validating RLVR research on diverse models to avoid drawing conclusions based on model-specific sensitivities to spurious signals.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research critically examines the efficacy of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its susceptibility to spurious reward signals, using the Qwen model family as a case study. The study reveals that Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, achieve significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning tasks even when trained with rewards that are unrelated or even contradictory to the correct answers. For instance, rewards based on incorrect labels, random signals, or mere output formatting can boost Qwen2.5-Math performance by substantial margins, sometimes rivaling gains from ground truth rewards. Crucially, these spurious rewards do not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, highlighting that Qwen's unique pre-training, particularly its \"code reasoning\" capability (using Python for thought processes without execution), is key to this susceptibility. The paper argues that RLVR often amplifies existing, latent reasoning abilities rather than teaching new ones, and that conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models may be misleading due to this model-specific sensitivity to weak or spurious signals. The authors strongly recommend validating RLVR research across diverse model architectures to ensure generalizability and avoid spurious correlations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen models, especially Qwen2.5-Math, show substantial performance gains in RLVR even with spurious rewards (e.g., incorrect labels, random signals, format rewards), sometimes matching ground truth reward performance.\n*   These gains from spurious rewards are highly model-specific and do not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math's pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capability (generating Python for problem-solving) is identified as a key factor enabling spurious rewards to elicit performance improvements.\n*   RLVR appears to amplify latent reasoning abilities present in the base model, rather than teaching novel skills, especially when using spurious rewards.\n*   The study advocates for validating RLVR research on diverse models to avoid drawing conclusions based on model-specific sensitivities to spurious signals.",
