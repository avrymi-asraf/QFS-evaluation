SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices to address challenges in model merging. The authors observe that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs can accurately represent a task's contribution. They propose TSV-Compress (TSV-C) to compress task vectors by retaining only the most significant TSVs, achieving substantial size reduction (10% of original) while preserving high accuracy (99%). Crucially for the user's interest, the paper leverages the geometric properties of TSVs to quantify and mitigate task interference. They introduce TSV-Merge (TSV-M), a novel approach that combines TSV compression with interference reduction. This reduction is achieved by decorrelating TSVs from different tasks using an orthogonalization technique, specifically solving an orthogonal Procrustes problem. This decorrelation minimizes cross-task interactions, leading to significantly improved performance in model merging compared to existing methods, as demonstrated by empirical results.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Task-specific feature bases (represented by per-layer task matrices) exhibit low-rank properties, allowing for compression using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).\n*   Singular Vectors derived from this decomposition (Task Singular Vectors or TSVs) are used to measure and reduce task interference.\n*   Orthogonal Procrustes analysis is employed to decorrelate TSVs from different tasks, effectively minimizing inter-task interference in model merging.\n*   The proposed TSV-Merge method combines this TSV compression with interference reduction via orthogonalization, outperforming existing model merging techniques.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices to address model merging and task interference. The authors demonstrate that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, allowing for significant compression (TSV-Compress) while retaining high accuracy. They further leverage TSVs to propose TSV-Merge, a novel model merging technique that combines compression with interference reduction. This is achieved by decorrelating TSVs across tasks using an orthogonal Procrustes transformation. The method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results by effectively reducing task interference, which is shown to be crucial for performance gains in model merging. The paper also highlights that TSV-Merge doesn't require tuning a scaling coefficient and that interference is higher in earlier layers.\n\n2.

The authors observe that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs captures most of the task-specific information. They propose TSV-Compress (TSV-C) to compress task vectors by retaining only the most significant TSVs, achieving substantial size reduction (10% of original) while preserving 99% of accuracy. Furthermore, they leverage the geometric properties of TSVs to measure and reduce task interference, a key issue in model merging. Their TSV-Merge (TSV-M) method combines this compression with interference reduction, notably using an orthogonal Procrustes problem to decorrelate TSVs from different tasks. TSV-M significantly outperforms existing model merging techniques, achieving state-of-the-art results by effectively mitigating task interference and enabling efficient model combination.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Task-specific weight differences (task vectors) at the layer level can be analyzed using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), yielding Task Singular Vectors (TSVs).\n*   Per-layer task matrices are observed to be low-rank, allowing for compression by retaining only the most significant TSVs (TSV-Compress, TSV-C).\n*   TSVs provide a basis for measuring and reducing task interference by analyzing the alignment and correlation between singular vectors of different tasks.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines low-rank compression of TSVs with a decorrelation step (using orthogonal Procrustes) to minimize task interference, leading to superior model merging performance.",

The authors demonstrate that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs can represent a task's function with high fidelity.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper explores the application of Orthogonal Procrustes analysis within the context of model merging, specifically to decorrelate task-specific feature bases represented by Task Singular Vectors (TSVs). The authors decompose per-layer task matrices into their singular values and vectors (TSVs), revealing that these matrices are inherently low-rank. They propose TSV-Compress (TSV-C) to efficiently compress task vectors by retaining only the most significant TSVs, achieving a 10x reduction while preserving 99% accuracy. To address task interference in model merging, they introduce TSV-Merge (TSV-M). This method leverages TSVs and decorrelates them across different tasks using a whitening transformation, formulated as an Orthogonal Procrustes problem. This process minimizes the alignment and divergence of singular vectors, thereby reducing interference. TSV-M significantly outperforms existing model merging techniques, demonstrating substantial accuracy gains.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Orthogonal Procrustes analysis is employed to decorrelate Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) for reducing task interference in model merging.\n*   Per-layer task matrices are shown to be low-rank, allowing for compression by retaining a small subset of TSVs.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) decorrelates TSVs using a whitening transformation, equivalent to Orthogonal Procrustes, to minimize inter-task interference.\n*   The proposed TSV-M method significantly improves model merging performance compared to existing techniques.",

These TSVs capture task-specific feature bases. The research demonstrates that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs can represent a task effectively. This insight leads to TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a method that compresses task vectors by up to 90% while retaining 99% accuracy. Furthermore, the paper proposes TSV-Merge (TSV-M), a novel model merging approach that leverages TSVs to reduce task interference. TSV-M tackles interference by decorrelating TSVs across tasks using a whitening transformation, formally achieved by solving an Orthogonal Procrustes problem (as detailed in Proposition 4.1). This approach significantly outperforms existing model merging techniques by combining compression with interference reduction, leading to state-of-the-art performance.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) are derived from the SVD of per-layer task matrices, representing task-specific feature bases.\n*   Per-layer task matrices are shown to be low-rank, enabling compression via TSV-Compress (TSV-C).\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) reduces task interference by decorrelating TSVs using an Orthogonal Procrustes problem.\n*   The proposed TSV-M method effectively combines compression and interference reduction to achieve superior model merging performance.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Task Singular Vectors (TSV) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices to address limitations in model merging, particularly task interference. The authors demonstrate that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs can represent a task's contribution with high fidelity. This observation leads to TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a method that compresses task vectors significantly (e.g., to 10% of original size) while preserving high accuracy. Building upon this, TSV-Merge (TSV-M) is proposed, which leverages the low-rank TSVs and further reduces task interference by decorrelating these vectors using an orthogonalization technique (specifically, solving an orthogonal Procrustes problem). This approach effectively mitigates interference between tasks, leading to superior performance in merged models compared to existing methods like Task Arithmetic and Consensus TA. An ablation study confirms that both low-rank approximation and interference reduction are crucial for TSV-M's success.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Task matrices are found to be inherently low-rank, allowing for compression by retaining only the most significant Task Singular Vectors (TSVs).\n*   TSV-Compress (TSV-C) effectively compresses task vectors by up to 10x while maintaining ~99% accuracy.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) decorrelates TSVs from different tasks using an orthogonal Procrustes approach to reduce task interference, significantly outperforming existing model merging techniques.\n*   Both low-rank approximation and interference reduction are essential components contributing to TSV-Merge's state-of-the-art performance.",

The authors highlight that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, allowing for compression. They propose TSV-Compress (TSV-C) to reduce task vectors to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% accuracy. Crucially for model merging, the paper leverages the geometric properties of TSVs to define and reduce task interference. TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines this compression with an interference reduction step that decorrelates TSVs across tasks. This decorrelation is achieved by applying a whitening transformation, specifically formulated as solving an orthogonal Procrustes problem (as detailed in Proposition 4.1), which finds an orthogonal matrix to minimize projection error. This approach significantly outperforms existing methods by reducing task interference and improving overall merged model performance. The paper defines Singular Task Interference (STI) as a measure of this cross-task interaction.\n\n2.

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\n\nThis paper introduces Task Singular Vectors (TSV) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices to address model merging challenges. The authors highlight that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, allowing for compression. They propose TSV-Compress (TSV-C) to reduce task vectors to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% accuracy. Crucially for model merging, the paper leverages the geometric properties of TSVs to define and reduce task interference. TSV-Merge (TSV-M) combines this compression with an interference reduction step that decorrelates TSVs across tasks. This decorrelation is achieved by applying a whitening transformation, specifically formulated as solving an orthogonal Procrustes problem (as detailed in Proposition 4.1), which finds an orthogonal matrix to minimize projection error. This approach significantly outperforms existing methods by reducing task interference and improving overall merged model performance. The paper defines Singular Task Interference (STI) as a measure of this cross-task interaction.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n*   Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) are extracted from per-layer task matrices using SVD, revealing their low-rank nature.\n*   TSV-Compress (TSV-C) compresses task vectors by 10x while preserving 99% accuracy.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) reduces task interference by decorrelating TSVs using an orthogonal Procrustes problem.\n*   The paper introduces Singular Task Interference (STI) as a metric to quantify cross-task interactions.\n*   Proposition 4.1 demonstrates the equivalence of whitening and solving the orthogonal Procrustes problem for decorrelating TSVs.",
