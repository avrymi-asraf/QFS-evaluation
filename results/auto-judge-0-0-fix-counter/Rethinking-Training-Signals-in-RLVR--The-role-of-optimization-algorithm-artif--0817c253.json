SUMMARY:\nThe paper investigates how Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can improve mathematical reasoning in language models, even when provided with \"spurious\" or noisy reward signals. Specifically for the GRPO optimization algorithm, the study reveals that a clipping mechanism plays a crucial role in transforming these noisy signals into a directional training signal. This mechanism, by favoring existing high-probability behaviors of the model, effectively upweights pre-existing reasoning strategies. For instance, Qwen2.5-Math models, which exhibit a strong propensity for \"code reasoning\" (using Python to assist in problem-solving), show significant performance gains when trained with random or incorrect rewards. This is because the clipping bias, inherent in GRPO, reinforces this existing code reasoning behavior, leading to improved accuracy. Without this clipping, random rewards fail to provide consistent gains, highlighting its importance in creating a useful training signal from noise. The effectiveness of this mechanism is model-dependent, with Qwen2.5-Math models benefiting significantly due to their pre-existing code reasoning capabilities.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   GRPO's clipping mechanism can transform noisy reward signals (like random rewards) into a directional training signal by reinforcing existing high-probability behaviors.\n*   For Qwen2.5-Math models, this clipping bias effectively upweights their pre-existing \"code reasoning\" (using Python for problem-solving), leading to performance gains even with spurious rewards.\n*   Without the clipping mechanism in GRPO, random rewards do not consistently improve performance, underscoring the critical role of clipping in creating a useful signal from noise.\n*   The effectiveness of this process is heavily dependent on the model's pre-existing reasoning strategies; Qwen2.5-Math models benefit due to their strong code reasoning prior, while other models without this prior do not.",

It demonstrates that Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models even with entirely random, or otherwise spurious, reward signals. The study highlights that the effectiveness of these spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, with Qwen2.5-Math models showing substantial gains while other families like Llama3 and OLMo2 do not. This phenomenon is attributed to Qwen2.5-Math's pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capability—using Python code to aid mathematical thought—which RLVR, particularly with GRPO's clipping bias, amplifies. The clipping mechanism in GRPO, by preferentially reinforcing high-probability token sequences, effectively upweights these pre-existing strategies, turning otherwise uninformative random rewards into a training signal. This suggests that RLVR often elicits latent capabilities rather than teaching new ones, and the observed gains are a consequence of the algorithm leveraging the model's inherent strengths, even when the reward signal is noisy.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The clipping mechanism in GRPO can create a directional training signal from random (noisy) rewards by amplifying pre-existing, high-probability behaviors within a model.\n*   Spurious rewards, including random ones, lead to significant performance gains in Qwen2.5-Math models, primarily by upweighting their inherent \"code reasoning\" strategy.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; Qwen2.5-Math models benefit due to their strong pre-existing code reasoning capabilities, while models lacking this do not.\n*   RLVR, especially with spurious rewards, appears to elicit latent reasoning strategies learned during pretraining rather than teaching new capabilities.\n*   The observed gains from random rewards are largely an artifact of the GRPO algorithm's clipping bias exploiting learned priors, not the informativeness of the random reward signal itself.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates how optimization algorithm artifacts, specifically the clipping mechanism in GRPO, can generate a directional training signal from noise. It demonstrates that Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models even with entirely random, or otherwise spurious, reward signals. The study highlights that the effectiveness of these spurious rewards is highly model-dependent, with Qwen2.5-Math models showing substantial gains while other families like Llama3 and OLMo2 do not. This phenomenon is attributed to Qwen2.5-Math's pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capability—using Python code to aid mathematical thought—which RLVR, particularly with GRPO's clipping bias, amplifies. The clipping mechanism in GRPO, by preferentially reinforcing high-probability token sequences, effectively upweights these pre-existing strategies, turning otherwise uninformative random rewards into a training signal. This suggests that RLVR often elicits latent capabilities rather than teaching new ones, and the observed gains are a consequence of the algorithm leveraging the model's inherent strengths, even when the reward signal is noisy.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The clipping mechanism in GRPO can create a directional training signal from random (noisy) rewards by amplifying pre-existing, high-probability behaviors within a model.\n*   Spurious rewards, including random ones, lead to significant performance gains in Qwen2.5-Math models, primarily by upweighting their inherent \"code reasoning\" strategy.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; Qwen2.5-Math models benefit due to their strong pre-existing code reasoning capabilities, while models lacking this do not.\n*   RLVR, especially with spurious rewards, appears to elicit latent reasoning strategies learned during pretraining rather than teaching new capabilities.\n*   The observed gains from random rewards are largely an artifact of the GRPO algorithm's clipping bias exploiting learned priors, not the informativeness of the random reward signal itself.",
