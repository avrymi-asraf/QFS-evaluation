      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces \"reflective augmentation\" (RefAug), a novel data augmentation strategy for training language models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning. Unlike traditional methods that expand the training dataset by creating more problems or re-sampling answers, RefAug embeds problem reflection into each training instance. This involves appending a \"reflective section\" to the original solution, which includes either alternative reasoning (different approaches to the same problem) or follow-up reasoning (generalizations or analogies to related problems). The key benefit of RefAug is its ability to foster a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts, leading to improved performance not only in standard single-round question-answering but also in more complex scenarios requiring reflective thinking. Crucially, RefAug is complementary to existing augmentation techniques and does not negatively impact inference efficiency, as the reflective sections are ignored during deployment. Experiments show RefAug significantly boosts performance and enhances models' ability to handle tasks like error correction and multi-turn reasoning, suggesting it addresses a gap left by current augmentation methods that primarily focus on data volume.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LLM mathematical reasoning by incorporating problem reflection (alternative/follow-up reasoning) into training data, rather than just increasing data quantity.\n*   This method improves performance in both standard math QA and complex reflective reasoning tasks, where traditional augmentation methods often fall short.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation strategies, leading to further performance gains when combined.\n*   The approach maintains inference efficiency as the reflective sections are not used during prediction.\n*   RefAug contributes to reducing reasoning errors, suggesting a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts by the LLM.",

Unlike traditional methods that expand the dataset by creating more problem instances, RefAug augments existing instances by appending a \"reflective section\" to the solution. This section includes alternative reasoning approaches and follow-up reasoning (abstraction or analogy) to encourage deeper problem understanding.

Importantly, RefAug is complementary to existing augmentation techniques, leading to further gains when combined. It also demonstrates effectiveness in code generation tasks. The analysis indicates that RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors, not calculation errors, and is efficient during inference due to early stopping. The study also confirms minimal data contamination risk.\n\n2.

Unlike traditional methods that expand the dataset by creating more problem instances, RefAug augments each training instance by appending a \"reflective section\" to the original solution. This section includes alternative reasoning approaches and follow-up reasoning (abstraction or analogy), encouraging deeper problem comprehension. Experiments show RefAug significantly improves performance on both standard single-round math QA and more complex reflective reasoning tasks. It complements existing data expansion techniques, leading to further gains. The study also explores RefAug's application in code generation, demonstrating its versatility. An ablation study confirms the benefit of both alternative and follow-up reasoning components. Efficiency analysis indicates minimal impact on training and inference time, with early stopping during inference preventing the generation of reflective content. Error analysis suggests RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LLM mathematical reasoning by embedding reflection (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data, going beyond simple data expansion.\n*   RefAug complements existing data augmentation methods, yielding synergistic performance improvements on both standard and reflective math reasoning tasks.\n*   The method is effective in code generation tasks, indicating broad applicability for improving LLM reasoning.\n*   RefAug improves inference efficiency by allowing early stopping before the reflective section during generation.\n*   Error analysis suggests RefAug primarily addresses reasoning errors, leading to more robust problem-solving.",

Unlike traditional methods that focus on expanding the dataset with more examples (question or answer augmentation), RefAug embeds problem reflection within each training instance. This is achieved by appending a \"reflective section\" to the original solution, which includes alternative reasoning (exploring different problem-solving approaches) and follow-up reasoning (generalizing or extending the problem). The study demonstrates that RefAug significantly enhances LLMs' performance on both standard single-round math problems and more complex reflective reasoning tasks, such as error correction and multi-turn problem-solving. Crucially, RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing augmentation techniques, leading to further performance gains when combined. The method maintains inference efficiency as the model stops generation before the reflective section. Experiments show RefAug's effectiveness across different LLM architectures and its potential to improve code generation tasks as well.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) enhances LLM mathematical reasoning by incorporating problem reflection (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data.\n*   RefAug complements existing data augmentation methods, leading to synergistic performance improvements.\n*   The method significantly boosts performance on complex reflective reasoning tasks where traditional augmentation methods fall short.\n*   RefAug does not negatively impact inference efficiency due to an early stopping mechanism.\n*   The approach shows promise beyond mathematical reasoning, improving performance in code generation tasks.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel data augmentation strategy for training Large Language Models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning. Unlike traditional methods that expand the training set with more examples, RefAug enriches each training instance with a \"reflective section.\" This section encourages the model to consider alternative approaches and follow-up reasoning, fostering a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and methodologies. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance on standard single-round math problems, achieving a +7.2 accuracy gain. Crucially, it excels in more complex reflective reasoning scenarios (like error correction and follow-up questions) where other augmentation methods falter. RefAug is also complementary to existing techniques, leading to further performance improvements when combined. The method is shown to be effective in code generation tasks as well. Analyses confirm that RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors, is scalable, and has minimal impact on inference efficiency due to early stopping. The stability of RefAug data annotation and its effectiveness with open-source models are also validated.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LLM mathematical reasoning by embedding alternative and follow-up reasoning into training data, improving deep understanding beyond simple data expansion.\n*   RefAug significantly boosts performance on both standard math problems (+7.2 accuracy) and complex reflective reasoning tasks, outperforming traditional augmentation methods in the latter.\n*   The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing data augmentation techniques (e.g., Question Augmentation, Answer Augmentation), leading to synergistic performance gains.\n*   RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors, showing that reflection deepens the model's grasp of underlying mathematical skills, and it does not negatively impact inference efficiency.\n*   RefAug is applicable to code generation and demonstrates stable performance gains regardless of minor variations in data annotation.",

Unlike traditional methods that expand the training set with more problem-answer pairs, RefAug enriches each instance by appending a \"reflective section.\" This section includes alternative reasoning approaches to solve the problem and follow-up reasoning, which generalizes the problem or applies its concepts to a more complex scenario. The core idea is to foster a deeper understanding of the problem-solving process rather than just increasing data volume. Experiments show that RefAug significantly boosts performance on standard math reasoning tasks, achieving a +7.2 accuracy gain. Crucially, it also dramatically enhances performance on more complex reflective reasoning tasks (e.g., follow-up questions, error correction), areas where traditional augmentation methods fall short. RefAug is complementary to existing techniques, leading to further gains when combined. The study also explores RefAug's effectiveness in code generation and confirms its minimal impact on inference efficiency due to early stopping.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LLM mathematical reasoning by embedding \"reflection\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data, improving understanding beyond mere answer generation.\n*   RefAug significantly boosts performance on both standard math reasoning (+7.2 accuracy) and complex reflective reasoning tasks, where other augmentation methods are less effective.\n*   The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing data augmentation strategies (like Q-Aug and A-Aug), leading to synergistic improvements.\n*   RefAug demonstrates effectiveness across different LLM architectures and shows promise in code generation tasks, highlighting reflection as a generally beneficial concept.\n*   Despite adding complexity to training instances, RefAug maintains inference efficiency due to an early stopping mechanism that skips the reflective section during generation.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces \"reflective augmentation\" (RefAug), a novel data augmentation strategy for Large Language Models (LLMs) focused on enhancing mathematical reasoning. Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the training set with more examples, RefAug embeds problem reflection into each training instance by appending alternative and follow-up reasoning sections. This approach deepens the model's understanding by encouraging consideration of different perspectives, abstractions, and analogies. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug not only improves performance on standard single-round math problems (outperforming direct fine-tuning by +7.2 accuracy) but also significantly enhances capabilities in complex reflective reasoning scenarios where other augmentation methods fall short. Crucially, RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to further substantial gains when combined. The method also shows promise in code generation and is effective even with a smaller proportion of augmented data. The analysis indicates that RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors, suggesting a deeper learning of underlying mathematical principles.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LLM mathematical reasoning by incorporating problem reflection (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data, rather than just increasing data volume.\n*   RefAug significantly boosts performance in both standard math QA (+7.2 accuracy) and specialized reflective reasoning tasks, where traditional augmentation methods are less effective.\n*   RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing augmentation techniques, leading to greater overall performance improvements when combined.\n*   The method is effective in code generation tasks and contributes to reducing reasoning errors in LLMs.\n*   RefAug maintains inference efficiency as the reflective sections are not used during prediction.",

Unlike traditional methods that expand the training dataset with more problems, RefAug enriches each existing training instance by appending a \"reflective section.\" This section encourages deeper understanding by incorporating alternative reasoning paths and follow-up scenarios (abstraction or analogy). The study demonstrates that RefAug significantly boosts performance on standard single-round math QA tasks, achieving a +7.2 accuracy gain. Crucially, it excels in complex reflective reasoning scenarios (like follow-up questions and error correction) where conventional augmentation methods falter. RefAug proves complementary to existing techniques, leading to further performance improvements when combined. An ablation study confirms the value of both alternative and follow-up reasoning components. The paper also analyzes training and inference efficiency, finding RefAug's impact to be minimal, and explores data annotation with open-source models, noting that higher quality annotations are needed for advanced reflective reasoning. Error analysis indicates RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors rather than calculation errors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LLM mathematical reasoning by embedding \"reflection\" (alternative/follow-up reasoning) into training data, improving both standard and complex reasoning tasks.\n*   RefAug provides a +7.2 accuracy gain on single-round math QA and significantly outperforms traditional data expansion methods on reflective reasoning tasks.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation strategies, yielding synergistic performance improvements.\n*   Error analysis shows RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors, indicating a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts.\n*   While RefAug increases training data complexity, its impact on inference efficiency is minimal due to early stopping during generation.",

Unlike traditional methods that expand the training set with more examples, RefAug enriches each training instance by appending a \"reflective section.\" This section encourages the LM to consider alternative approaches and follow-up reasoning (abstraction or analogy) for the given problem. Experiments show that RefAug not only improves performance on standard single-round math QA tasks but also significantly enhances capabilities in more complex reflective reasoning scenarios, such as follow-up questions and error correction. RefAug demonstrates strong complementarity with existing augmentation techniques, leading to further performance gains. The study also explores RefAug's application in code generation, showing its generalizability. Notably, RefAug maintains inference efficiency as the reflective section is not used during testing. The analysis also delves into the efficiency trade-offs, showing that while RefAug adds some training time, it's less impactful than dataset expansion and doesn't hinder inference speed.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LLM mathematical reasoning by adding \"reflective sections\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) to training data, rather than just increasing the number of examples.\n*   RefAug improves performance on both standard math problems and more complex reflective reasoning tasks, complementing existing augmentation methods.\n*   The strategy is effective across different LLM architectures and shows promise in code generation tasks as well.\n*   RefAug maintains inference efficiency, as the reflective content is only used during training.\n*   While RefAug adds some training overhead, it is generally less impactful than methods that significantly expand the dataset size.",

Unlike traditional methods that focus on expanding the dataset with more problem instances, RefAug aims to deepen the understanding of existing problems by embedding reflective components into each training instance. These components include alternative reasoning (presenting different solution approaches) and follow-up reasoning (generalizing or extending the problem). Experiments show that RefAug significantly improves performance on both standard single-round math QA tasks and more complex reflective reasoning scenarios, where it outperforms traditional augmentation methods. Importantly, RefAug is complementary to existing techniques, leading to even greater gains when combined. The efficiency of RefAug is also noted, as it adds minimal overhead during inference due to early stopping.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) enhances LM mathematical reasoning by adding \"alternative\" and \"follow-up\" reasoning to training instances, aiming for deeper problem understanding rather than just dataset expansion.\n*   RefAug significantly boosts performance on both standard math QA and complex reflective reasoning tasks, outperforming traditional data augmentation methods in the latter.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing augmentation strategies (e.g., question and answer augmentation), leading to synergistic performance improvements.\n*   The method maintains inference efficiency as the model stops generation before the reflective sections.\n*   Ablation studies show that both alternative and follow-up reasoning components contribute to performance gains, with their combination yielding the best results.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces \"reflective augmentation\" (RefAug) as a novel data augmentation strategy for training language models (LMs) in mathematical reasoning. Unlike traditional methods that focus on expanding the dataset with more problem instances, RefAug aims to deepen the understanding of existing problems by embedding reflective components into each training instance. These components include alternative reasoning (presenting different solution approaches) and follow-up reasoning (generalizing or extending the problem). Experiments show that RefAug significantly improves performance on both standard single-round math QA tasks and more complex reflective reasoning scenarios, where it outperforms traditional augmentation methods. Importantly, RefAug is complementary to existing techniques, leading to even greater gains when combined. The efficiency of RefAug is also noted, as it adds minimal overhead during inference due to early stopping.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) enhances LM mathematical reasoning by adding \"alternative\" and \"follow-up\" reasoning to training instances, aiming for deeper problem understanding rather than just dataset expansion.\n*   RefAug significantly boosts performance on both standard math QA and complex reflective reasoning tasks, outperforming traditional data augmentation methods in the latter.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing augmentation strategies (e.g., question and answer augmentation), leading to synergistic performance improvements.\n*   The method maintains inference efficiency as the model stops generation before the reflective sections.\n*   Ablation studies show that both alternative and follow-up reasoning components contribute to performance gains, with their combination yielding the best results.",
