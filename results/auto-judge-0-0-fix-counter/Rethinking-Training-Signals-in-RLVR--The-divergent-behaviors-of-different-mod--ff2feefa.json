SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and finds that while it can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, even with spurious reward signals (like random or incorrect labels), this effectiveness does not generalize to other model families such as Llama3 or OLMo2. The study highlights a fundamental lack of technique generalization in RLVR, as these spurious rewards either yield minimal gains or even degrade performance on non-Qwen models. This divergence is attributed to pre-training differences; Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a distinct \"code reasoning\" behavior (generating Python code to assist in problem-solving) that is effectively amplified by RLVR, even with weak signals. In contrast, other models either lack this capability or use it in a way that correlates with worse performance. The research suggests that RLVR might be primarily surfacing and upweighting existing reasoning strategies rather than teaching new ones, underscoring the importance of evaluating RLVR techniques across diverse model architectures.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels) significantly boosts Qwen2.5-Math model performance, matching gains from ground truth rewards.\n*   These same spurious rewards fail to generalize, yielding minimal or negative performance gains on Llama3 and OLMo2 model families.\n*   The differing effectiveness is linked to pre-training: Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit strong \"code reasoning\" (using Python for thought processes) that RLVR amplifies.\n*   RLVR appears to primarily elicit and upweight existing reasoning capabilities rather than teaching new ones, a phenomenon that is highly model-dependent.\n*   The findings indicate a fundamental lack of technique generalization in current RLVR approaches, necessitating validation across diverse models.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and finds that while it can significantly improve mathematical reasoning, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the model family. Specifically, RLVR training with \"spurious\" rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels, or format-based) yields substantial performance gains on Qwen2.5-Math models, often approaching the improvements seen with ground truth rewards. This suggests RLVR might be eliciting latent reasoning abilities from pre-training. However, these same spurious rewards show minimal or even negative impact on other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2. This divergence highlights a fundamental lack of technique generalization in RLVR. The research further identifies \"code reasoning\"—generating Python code to aid mathematical thinking—as a distinctive behavior in Qwen2.5-Math models that RLVR effectively upweights, even with spurious signals. This pre-existing, performance-correlated reasoning strategy is less prevalent or absent in other model families, explaining their failure to benefit from the same RLVR techniques. The study concludes that pre-training data and learned reasoning strategies heavily influence RLVR outcomes, and validation should extend beyond commonly used models like Qwen.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels) significantly improves performance on Qwen2.5-Math models, but not on Llama3 or OLMo2 models.\n*   This disparity demonstrates a critical lack of generalization for RLVR techniques across different model families.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a unique \"code reasoning\" behavior (using Python for math) that RLVR effectively amplifies, contributing to performance gains even with weak signals.\n*   Differences in pre-training data and learned reasoning strategies are hypothesized to be the primary drivers for the model-specific effectiveness of RLVR.\n*   The findings suggest that conclusions drawn from RLVR research on Qwen models may not be universally applicable to other model architectures.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness across different model families. The study reveals a significant divergence in how models like Qwen, Llama, and OLMo respond to identical RLVR training, particularly with \"spurious rewards\" (e.g., random, incorrect, or format-based rewards). While Qwen models, especially Qwen2.5-Math, show substantial performance gains even with these flawed reward signals, Llama and OLMo models exhibit minimal or no improvement, and sometimes even degrade. This highlights a fundamental lack of technique generalization in RLVR. The researchers hypothesize that Qwen models leverage pre-existing reasoning capabilities, such as \"code reasoning\" (using Python to aid mathematical problem-solving without actual execution), which RLVR effectively amplifies. For other models, these underlying reasoning strategies are either absent or not easily elicited by RLVR, explaining their failure to benefit from spurious rewards. The study emphasizes the need to validate RLVR techniques on diverse model architectures to understand their true generalization capabilities.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards yields significant performance gains on Qwen models but fails to generalize to Llama and OLMo models, indicating a lack of technique generalization.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models demonstrate a unique ability to benefit from RLVR even with incorrect, random, or format-based rewards, suggesting they can leverage pre-existing reasoning patterns.\n*   \"Code reasoning,\" the use of Python for mathematical thinking without execution, is a key pre-existing behavior in Qwen models that RLVR effectively amplifies, leading to performance improvements.\n*   Other model families like Llama and OLMo do not show similar gains because they lack these easily elicitable, performance-correlated reasoning strategies, or their optimal strategies differ.\n*   The study strongly advises that future RLVR research should be validated on diverse model families, not just Qwen, to ensure generalizability and avoid drawing conclusions based on model-specific behaviors.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness across different model families, specifically highlighting the divergent behaviors of Qwen, Llama, and OLMo models. The study reveals that while RLVR can elicit significant mathematical reasoning improvements in Qwen models, even with spurious or weak reward signals (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels), these gains do not generalize to Llama or OLMo models. These latter models either show minimal improvement or even degrade performance under similar spurious training conditions. The paper hypothesizes that this divergence stems from underlying pre-training strategies, identifying Qwen models' strong \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for mathematical thought processes) as a key factor. RLVR appears to amplify this pre-existing capability in Qwen models, leading to performance boosts regardless of reward signal quality. In contrast, other models either lack this specific reasoning strategy or employ it ineffectively, rendering spurious rewards unhelpful. This underscores a fundamental lack of technique generalization in RLVR across different model architectures and pre-training regimes.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels) significantly improve Qwen model performance in RLVR, often matching ground truth reward gains.\n*   These same spurious rewards fail to yield performance improvements in Llama and OLMo models, indicating a lack of generalization for RLVR techniques.\n*   Qwen models exhibit a strong pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capability (using Python for math), which RLVR effectively amplifies, driving performance gains.\n*   Other model families (Llama, OLMo) either lack this code reasoning ability or use it suboptimally, explaining their failure to benefit from spurious RLVR training.\n*   The study suggests RLVR's effectiveness is heavily dependent on the model's pre-training strategies and existing reasoning patterns, not just the reward signal itself.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its efficacy across different model families, revealing a significant lack of technique generalization. While RLVR, even with spurious rewards (e.g., incorrect labels, random rewards, format adherence), dramatically improves the performance of Qwen2.5-Math models, these same spurious rewards largely fail to yield gains for other models like Llama3 and OLMo2. This divergence is attributed to differences in pretraining strategies. Specifically, Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a unique \"code reasoning\" behavior—generating Python code to aid mathematical reasoning without execution—which RLVR effectively upweights, even with flawed reward signals. In contrast, other models either don't exhibit this behavior or their attempts at code reasoning are detrimental. The findings underscore that RLVR's success is heavily dependent on the base model's pre-existing reasoning capabilities, rather than the reward signal's inherent quality, and highlight the need for broader model validation in RLVR research.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards significantly boosts Qwen2.5-Math model performance, but these rewards fail to generalize to other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, indicating a fundamental lack of technique generalization.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a distinct \"code reasoning\" capability (generating code for math problems without execution), which RLVR effectively amplifies, driving performance gains even with non-informative or incorrect rewards.\n*   Other model families (Llama3, OLMo2) do not benefit from spurious RLVR rewards, either lacking effective code reasoning or showing performance degradation when attempting it, suggesting pretraining differences are key.\n*   The study suggests RLVR primarily elicits and upweights pre-existing reasoning patterns within a model rather than teaching new capabilities, making its effectiveness highly dependent on the base model's learned behaviors.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse model architectures, not just Qwen models, to avoid drawing conclusions based on model-specific sensitivities to reward signals.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and highlights a significant lack of technique generalization across different model families, specifically Qwen, Llama, and OLMo. The research demonstrates that while RLVR can elicit substantial improvements in mathematical reasoning for Qwen models, even with spurious or weak reward signals (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, format adherence), these same techniques often fail to yield similar gains for Llama or OLMo models. This divergence suggests that the effectiveness of RLVR is heavily influenced by pretraining data and learned reasoning strategies. For Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, a key factor identified is their propensity for \"code reasoning\" – generating Python code to assist in solving problems, even without execution. RLVR, especially with spurious rewards, appears to upweight this pre-existing capability in Qwen models, leading to performance boosts. However, other model families lack this robust code reasoning ability, rendering the same RLVR strategies ineffective or even detrimental. The study concludes that RLVR research should be validated on diverse model architectures to avoid drawing conclusions based on model-specific behaviors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR training with spurious rewards (random, incorrect labels, format) significantly improves Qwen models' mathematical reasoning but fails to generalize to Llama and OLMo models.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a distinctive \"code reasoning\" behavior (generating Python code for problem-solving) which is effectively amplified by RLVR, even with weak signals.\n*   Other model families (Llama, OLMo) lack this strong, beneficial code reasoning capability, explaining their limited response to the same RLVR techniques.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR is highly dependent on the model's pretraining and pre-existing reasoning strategies, indicating a fundamental lack of technique generalization.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated across diverse model families to account for these model-specific outcomes.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) across different language model families, specifically Qwen, Llama, and OLMo. The study reveals a significant lack of generalization for RLVR techniques, particularly when employing \"spurious\" or weak reward signals. While Qwen models, especially Qwen2.5-Math, show substantial performance improvements even with random or incorrect rewards, Llama and OLMo models exhibit minimal gains or even degrade. This divergence is attributed to pre-training differences, with Qwen models demonstrating a notable \"code reasoning\" capability (using Python for mathematical thinking) that is effectively amplified by RLVR, regardless of reward quality. In contrast, other models either lack this specific reasoning strategy or employ it ineffectively. The findings underscore that RLVR's success is heavily dependent on the model's pre-existing reasoning abilities, rather than solely on the reward signal itself, highlighting a fundamental issue with technique generalization in current RLVR practices.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR training with spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels) significantly boosts performance in Qwen models, often matching ground truth reward gains.\n*   These same spurious rewards yield minimal to negative performance improvements in Llama and OLMo models, indicating a lack of technique generalization across model families.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a distinct \"code reasoning\" behavior (using Python for math), which RLVR effectively amplifies, leading to performance gains even with weak rewards.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is strongly tied to the model's pre-existing reasoning strategies, suggesting that RLVR primarily elicits latent capabilities rather than teaching new ones.\n*   The study cautions that conclusions drawn from Qwen-centric RLVR research may not generalize to other model architectures due to these differing underlying reasoning patterns.",

The core finding is a significant divergence in how these models respond to identical RLVR training signals, particularly when using \"spurious\" or weak rewards (e.g., random, format-based, or incorrect labels). While Qwen models, especially Qwen2.5-Math, show substantial performance improvements with these weak signals, often matching ground truth rewards, Llama and OLMo models exhibit minimal gains or even degradation. This indicates a fundamental lack of technique generalization in RLVR. The research hypothesizes that this divergence stems from pre-training differences; Qwen models, for instance, exhibit a strong pre-existing tendency towards \"code reasoning\" (using Python to assist reasoning without execution), which RLVR effectively amplifies, leading to performance gains. This code reasoning capability is less prevalent or less effective in other model families, explaining their inability to benefit from spurious rewards. The study concludes that RLVR's effectiveness is heavily model-dependent, urging future research to validate findings across diverse models rather than relying solely on Qwen.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR training with spurious rewards leads to significant performance gains in Qwen models but fails to generalize to Llama and OLMo models, highlighting a lack of technique generalization.\n*   Qwen models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math, demonstrate a strong pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capability (using Python for mathematical problem-solving) that is effectively amplified by RLVR, even with weak or random reward signals.\n*   Other model families (Llama, OLMo) do not exhibit this code reasoning behavior to the same extent, thus failing to benefit from the same RLVR training strategies.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR is heavily influenced by the model's pre-training, as it appears to elicit latent reasoning abilities rather than teaching new ones, especially when using spurious rewards.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse model families to avoid drawing conclusions based on model-specific behaviors.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\n\nThis paper investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) across different model families (Qwen, Llama, OLMo) and highlights a significant lack of technique generalization. The research demonstrates that while RLVR, even with spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels, or format adherence), can substantially improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, these gains do not consistently transfer to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2. These latter models often show minimal improvement or even performance degradation when trained with the same spurious reward signals. The study posits that these divergent outcomes are primarily due to differences in pre-training, specifically the presence of pre-existing reasoning strategies. Qwen2.5-Math models, for instance, exhibit a strong propensity for \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to aid mathematical thought), which RLVR effectively amplifies, leading to performance boosts. This suggests that RLVR's success is highly dependent on the base model's pre-trained capabilities and that current RLVR techniques may not be universally applicable.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards significantly improves Qwen2.5-Math models, often matching gains from ground-truth rewards.\n*   These spurious rewards and the gains they elicit do not generalize to other model families such as Llama3 and OLMo2, which show little to no improvement or performance degradation.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR is strongly influenced by pre-existing reasoning strategies within models; Qwen2.5-Math's \"code reasoning\" is identified as a key factor enabling spurious reward success.\n*   This divergence across model families indicates a fundamental lack of generalization in current RLVR techniques, suggesting that pre-training plays a crucial role in RLVR outcomes.\n*   The research advises validating RLVR findings on diverse model architectures, not solely on Qwen models, due to this observed lack of generalization.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with spurious reward signals, demonstrating that such methods can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models. Counterintuitively, even rewards with no or negative correlation to the correct answer, such as random or incorrect labels, yielded substantial gains, sometimes approaching those from ground truth rewards. This suggests RLVR might be eliciting latent reasoning abilities from pre-training rather than teaching new ones. A critical finding is the lack of generalization of these spurious rewards to other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, which showed minimal or no improvement. This divergence is attributed to differences in pre-training data and learned reasoning strategies, with Qwen2.5-Math models uniquely exhibiting \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for thought processes) that is strongly correlated with performance and is effectively upweighted by RLVR, even with spurious rewards. This highlights a fundamental lack of technique generalization in RLVR, emphasizing that conclusions drawn from Qwen models may not apply universally.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels) significantly boosts mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, often comparable to ground truth rewards.\n*   These spurious reward techniques fail to generalize to other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, which show minimal or negative gains.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a unique \"code reasoning\" behavior (using Python for thought) that is strongly correlated with performance and is effectively amplified by RLVR, even with weak/spurious rewards.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is heavily dependent on the model's pre-training data and pre-existing reasoning strategies, not the quality of the reward signal itself.\n*   The findings underscore a fundamental lack of generalization in RLVR techniques, cautioning against drawing conclusions solely from Qwen-centric experiments.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with spurious reward signals, demonstrating that such methods can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models. Counterintuitively, even rewards with no or negative correlation to the correct answer, such as random or incorrect labels, yielded substantial gains, sometimes approaching those from ground truth rewards. This suggests RLVR might be eliciting latent reasoning abilities from pre-training rather than teaching new ones. A critical finding is the lack of generalization of these spurious rewards to other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, which showed minimal or no improvement. This divergence is attributed to differences in pre-training data and learned reasoning strategies, with Qwen2.5-Math models uniquely exhibiting \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for thought processes) that is strongly correlated with performance and is effectively upweighted by RLVR, even with spurious rewards. This highlights a fundamental lack of technique generalization in RLVR, emphasizing that conclusions drawn from Qwen models may not apply universally.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels) significantly boosts mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models, often comparable to ground truth rewards.\n*   These spurious reward techniques fail to generalize to other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2, which show minimal or negative gains.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a unique \"code reasoning\" behavior (using Python for thought) that is strongly correlated with performance and is effectively amplified by RLVR, even with weak/spurious rewards.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is heavily dependent on the model's pre-training data and pre-existing reasoning strategies, not the quality of the reward signal itself.\n*   The findings underscore a fundamental lack of generalization in RLVR techniques, cautioning against drawing conclusions solely from Qwen-centric experiments.",
