The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset for a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. They found that RL fine-tuning can lead to rapid reasoning gains, significantly improving accuracy on benchmarks like AMC23 and AIME24, even surpassing larger models in some cases, all at a fraction of the cost. However, prolonged training resulted in optimization instability and performance degradation. Challenges identified include the model's struggle with strict length constraints, where longer reasoning chains were truncated, leading to errors and language drift. Using a mix of easy and hard problems and employing cosine rewards helped stabilize training and control output length, though extended lengths were still needed for highly complex tasks. These findings suggest that while RL is effective for small LLMs, careful consideration of training duration, data mix, reward functions, and length constraints is crucial to mitigate instability and performance degradation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements with RL fine-tuning, even under tight computational and data constraints.\n*   Prolonged RL fine-tuning on small LLMs can lead to optimization instability and performance degradation, particularly due to strict length constraints.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems in the training data and using cosine rewards can help stabilize training and manage output length.\n*   Despite improvements, challenges like language drift and the need for longer completion lengths for complex tasks remain for small, multilingual base models.\n*   The study demonstrates a cost-effective approach to enhancing LLM reasoning, achieving competitive results with minimal resources.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of small language models (LLMs), specifically a 1.5-billion-parameter model, under strict computational constraints. Experiment 1 showed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 70%) within the first 50-100 training steps using high-quality data. However, prolonged training led to performance degradation and instability, likely due to length constraints. Experiment 2, by mixing easier and harder problems and reducing length limits, improved initial performance further (AMC23 to 80%) and stabilized behavior, but long-term instability persisted. Experiment 3 introduced a cosine reward to better control output length, leading to more consistent training but slightly lower peak performance. Overall, the developed Open-RS models achieved competitive reasoning scores, even surpassing some larger models on specific benchmarks like AIME24 (46.7%), at a significantly lower cost ($42) and with less data than many baselines. Key challenges identified include optimization instability and length limitations during prolonged training, especially with multilingual base models. Future work could explore extended training, better language control, and hybrid RL-search methods.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n* Small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements within 50-100 RL fine-tuning steps, but prolonged training can lead to performance degradation and instability, particularly under strict length constraints.\n* Mixing easier and harder problems can enhance early performance and stabilize reasoning behavior, though long-term stability remains a challenge.\n* Cosine rewards effectively stabilize completion lengths, improving training consistency, but may sacrifice peak accuracy compared to other reward functions.\n* The presented RL fine-tuning approach significantly boosts small LLMs' reasoning abilities (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) with minimal data and cost ($42), making it a viable alternative for resource-constrained settings.\n* Optimization instability and length constraints are identified as primary challenges during prolonged RL fine-tuning of small LLMs.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for improving the reasoning capabilities of small language models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints. The researchers fine-tuned a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and a curated mathematical reasoning dataset on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours.\n\nExperiment 1 showed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains within 50-100 steps but degrade with prolonged training, especially under length constraints. Experiment 2, by mixing easy and hard problems with reduced length limits, improved initial performance and stabilized behavior, but long-term stability remained an issue. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to control output length, enhancing training consistency, but longer completion lengths were still needed for complex tasks.\n\nOverall, the Open-RS models achieved competitive performance, with Open-RS3 scoring 46.7% on AIME24, surpassing OpenAI's o1-preview. The approach demonstrated significant cost and data efficiency compared to larger models. Key limitations include the insufficient completion length for very hard problems and potential multilingual drift from the base model. Future work could explore extended training durations, explicit language control, and hybrid methods to further enhance reasoning capabilities.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements within 50-100 RL fine-tuning steps on high-quality data, but performance degrades with prolonged training and strict length constraints.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems with reduced length limits (Experiment 2) improves initial performance and stabilizes reasoning behavior, though long-term stability remains a challenge.\n*   Cosine rewards effectively stabilize completion lengths, improving training consistency, but longer context windows are still needed for extremely difficult tasks.\n*   The proposed RL fine-tuning approach achieved competitive reasoning performance (e.g., 46.7% on AIME24) with minimal data and cost ($42), significantly outperforming resource-intensive baselines.\n*   Optimization instability and insufficient completion length for complex problems were identified as key challenges during prolonged fine-tuning.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under strict computational constraints. The research focused on a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, trained on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours. The experiments explored different data strategies and reward functions to optimize performance.\n\nExperiment 1 showed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 70%) within the first 50-100 steps using high-quality data. However, prolonged training led to performance degradation and instability, likely due to length constraints. Experiment 2, by mixing easy and hard problems with reduced length limits, improved initial performance (AMC23 to 80%) and stabilized behavior, though long-term instability persisted. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to better control output length, resulting in more stable completion lengths and consistent training, although peak performance was slightly lower.\n\nOverall, the trained models (Open-RS variants) achieved competitive results, with one variant reaching 46.7% on AIME24, surpassing OpenAI's o1-preview. The approach demonstrated significant cost and data efficiency ($42 and 7,000 samples) compared to larger models. Key limitations identified include insufficient length constraints for complex tasks, multilingual drift from the base model, and the need for further exploration beyond mathematical reasoning.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) within the first 50-100 RL steps using high-quality data.\n*   Prolonged RL fine-tuning on small LLMs can lead to optimization instability and performance degradation, particularly when facing strict length constraints.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems, along with using cosine rewards to control output length, can enhance early performance and training stability, but does not fully resolve long-term issues like multilingual drift.\n*   RL fine-tuning of small LLMs can be highly cost-effective and data-efficient, achieving competitive reasoning performance at a fraction of the resources required by larger models.\n*   Key challenges for RL fine-tuning of small LLMs include handling extremely complex tasks requiring extended reasoning chains due to length limitations and mitigating multilingual tendencies from the base model.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study explores the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints. The researchers fine-tuned a 1.5-billion-parameter model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and a curated mathematical reasoning dataset. Experiment 1 showed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 70%) within the first 50-100 steps, but prolonged training led to performance degradation and instability, likely due to length constraints. Experiment 2, incorporating a mix of easy and hard problems with reduced length limits, improved initial performance (AMC23 to 80%) and stabilized behavior, though long-term stability remained an issue. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to better control output length, leading to more consistent lengths and modest performance gains, but it did not fully resolve multilingual tendencies or the need for longer contexts for very difficult problems. Despite these challenges, the developed models (Open-RS variants) achieved competitive performance, even surpassing some larger models on specific benchmarks like AIME24, at a significantly lower cost ($42) and with less data than many baselines.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n* Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements with RL within the first 50-100 training steps using high-quality data, but prolonged training under strict length constraints can lead to performance degradation and instability.\n* Mixing easier problems with harder ones and reducing length constraints can enhance early performance and stabilize reasoning behavior in small LLMs, though long-term stability remains a challenge.\n* Cosine rewards effectively stabilize completion lengths in small LLMs, improving training consistency, but may require longer context windows for extremely complex tasks and careful handling of multilingual base models.\n* The study demonstrated that small LLMs, fine-tuned with RL on a limited dataset and under strict resource constraints, can achieve competitive reasoning performance rivaling or exceeding larger models and other small models, at a fraction of the computational cost.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small language models (LLMs) under resource constraints. The researchers fine-tuned a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and a curated mathematical reasoning dataset. Experiment 1 showed rapid initial reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 70%) within 50-100 steps, but performance degraded with prolonged training due to instability and length constraints, with outputs becoming unreadable and drifting to non-English. Experiment 2, incorporating a mix of easy and hard problems and reduced length limits, improved initial performance significantly (AMC23 to 80%), but still faced late-stage instability. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to stabilize completion lengths, leading to more consistent training but slightly lower peak performance. Despite these challenges, the developed models (Open-RS variants) achieved competitive reasoning scores, even surpassing o1-preview on AIME24, at a significantly lower cost ($42) and with less data than larger models. The study identifies optimization instability and length constraints as key challenges during RL fine-tuning of small LLMs.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RL fine-tuning can rapidly improve small LLMs' reasoning (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%), but prolonged training leads to optimization instability and performance degradation.\n*   Key challenges during RL fine-tuning of small LLMs include optimization instability and strict length constraints that can lead to truncated reasoning and unreadable outputs.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems and using cosine rewards can help stabilize training and control output length, mitigating some instability issues.\n*   The proposed approach significantly outperforms baseline 1.5B models and is cost-effective ($42 vs. thousands) and data-efficient compared to larger models, demonstrating the viability of RL for small LLMs.\n*   The zero-shot pass@1 metric was used to evaluate reasoning capabilities, highlighting the models' ability to solve problems independently.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the efficacy of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under strict computational constraints. Researchers fine-tuned a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and a curated mathematical reasoning dataset. The experiments revealed that while small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) within the initial 50-100 training steps, prolonged training leads to optimization instability and performance degradation. This degradation is attributed to challenges with strict length constraints and potential reward misalignment. Mixing easier and harder problems, along with employing cosine rewards to control output length, showed improvements in early performance and training stability. Despite these challenges, the RL-based approach achieved competitive performance against larger models and was significantly more cost-effective ($42 vs. thousands of dollars). The study highlights that while RL is a viable path for improving small LLM reasoning, careful consideration of training duration, length constraints, and reward design is crucial to mitigate instability.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints. The research focuses on a 1.5B parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, trained on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours.\n\nExperiment 1 demonstrated that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains within the first 50-100 training steps using high-quality data, but prolonged training leads to performance degradation and unstable outputs, likely due to length constraints and reward misalignment.\n\nExperiment 2 introduced a mix of easy and hard problems, improving initial performance and stabilizing behavior by encouraging more concise reasoning. However, long-term stability remained an issue.\n\nExperiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to better control output length, leading to more consistent training, though peak performance on complex tasks was slightly lower. This experiment also highlighted the need for extended length limits and explicit language constraints for multilingual base models.\n\nOverall, the Open-RS models achieved competitive performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, even surpassing some larger models on specific tasks, at a significantly lower cost ($42) and with less data compared to existing baselines. The study identifies optimization instability and length constraints as key challenges during RL fine-tuning of small LLMs.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 from 63% to 80%) within 50-100 RL fine-tuning steps, but prolonged training can lead to instability and performance degradation, particularly under strict length constraints.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems can enhance early performance and stabilize reasoning behavior in small LLMs, though long-term stability remains a challenge.\n*   Cosine rewards effectively stabilize output lengths, improving training consistency, but extended length limits are crucial for complex tasks, especially with multilingual base models.\n*   RL fine-tuning of small LLMs can be highly cost-effective ($42 in this study) and data-efficient, achieving competitive results against larger models and outperforming other 1.5B models on specific benchmarks.\n*   Key challenges identified during RL fine-tuning of small LLMs include optimization instability, the need for careful reward design, and managing output length and language consistency.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study explores the efficacy and challenges of using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of small language models (LLMs) under strict computational constraints. Focusing on a 1.5B parameter model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) and using the GRPO algorithm with a curated mathematical reasoning dataset, the research found that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) within the first 50-100 training steps. However, prolonged training led to performance degradation, optimization instability, and issues like output length constraints and multilingual drift. Experiment 2, which balanced easy and hard problems, showed improved initial performance and more stable behavior. Experiment 3, using a cosine reward to control output length, stabilized completion lengths but slightly reduced peak accuracy. Overall, the proposed methods achieved competitive performance with significantly lower data and computational costs compared to larger models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n* Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning gains within the first 50-100 RL fine-tuning steps, but performance degrades with prolonged training due to instability and length constraints.\n* Mixing easier and harder problems in the training data can stabilize reasoning behavior and improve initial performance.\n* Cosine rewards effectively control output length, contributing to training consistency, but may limit peak accuracy on complex tasks.\n* The developed RL approach for small LLMs is highly cost-efficient, costing approximately $42 and using a small dataset, significantly less than comparable larger models.\n* Challenges encountered include optimization instability, insufficient length constraints for complex problems, and multilingual drift from the base model.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small language models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints. Using a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and the GRPO algorithm, the research demonstrates rapid reasoning improvements on mathematical benchmarks. Experiment 1 showed initial gains within 50-100 steps, but performance degraded with prolonged training due to length constraints. Experiment 2, by mixing easy and hard problems, improved early performance and stabilized behavior but still faced late-stage instability. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to better control output length, leading to more stable training but requiring longer completion lengths for complex tasks. The findings highlight that small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning gains with minimal data and cost, outperforming larger models on specific tasks, but face challenges with optimization stability and length limitations during prolonged training.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n* Small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements within 50-100 training steps using RL and high-quality data, but prolonged training can lead to performance degradation due to length constraints.\n* Mixing easier problems with challenging ones can enhance early performance and stabilize reasoning behavior in small LLMs, though long-term stability remains a challenge.\n* Cosine rewards effectively stabilize output lengths, improving training consistency, but longer completion lengths are needed for extremely hard tasks, especially with multilingual base models.\n* The research demonstrates that RL-based fine-tuning for small LLMs can be highly cost-effective and data-efficient, achieving competitive results with minimal resources.",
