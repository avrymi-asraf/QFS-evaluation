The researchers fine-tuned a 1.5-billion-parameter model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) under strict resource constraints (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24 hours). They found that while RL can rapidly improve reasoning capabilities (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80% within 50-100 steps), prolonged training or exceeding length limits (4096 tokens) led to performance degradation, unstable optimization, and even non-English outputs. Using a mixed dataset of easy and hard problems and a cosine reward to control length improved initial performance and stability, but longer completion lengths were still needed for very difficult tasks. The study demonstrates that even with limited data and computational resources, RL can make small LLMs competitive in reasoning, but output length constraints pose significant challenges to stability and efficacy in complex reasoning scenarios.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Strict output length constraints (e.g., 4096 tokens) can lead to performance degradation and instability in small LLMs trained with RL for complex reasoning tasks, especially with prolonged training.\n*   Mixing easier problems with harder ones, combined with reduced length constraints, can improve initial reasoning performance and stabilize behavior, but long-term stability remains a challenge.\n*   Cosine rewards help stabilize output lengths, enhancing training consistency, but longer completion limits are necessary for very complex reasoning tasks.\n*   Despite limitations, RL-based fine-tuning allows small LLMs to achieve competitive reasoning performance with minimal data and cost, outperforming larger models in some benchmarks.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model can contribute to language drift and complicate monolingual optimization under length constraints.",

The researchers found that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements with limited high-quality data within the initial training steps. However, prolonged training under strict length constraints led to performance degradation, unstable optimization, and even non-English outputs, particularly with multilingual base models. Experimentally, mixing easier problems with harder ones (Experiment 2) improved initial performance and stabilized behavior compared to using only high-quality, difficult data. Using a cosine reward (Experiment 3) effectively controlled output length, enhancing training consistency, though it slightly reduced peak performance. Overall, the fine-tuned small LLMs (Open-RS variants) demonstrated competitive reasoning capabilities, even surpassing some larger models on specific benchmarks like AIME24, while utilizing significantly fewer resources and lower costs. The limitations identified, such as the insufficiency of length constraints for extremely hard problems and the multilingual nature of the base model, suggest future work should explore extended training, adaptive length strategies, and explicit language control.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n* Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning gains with limited high-quality data and RL in early training stages, but prolonged training under strict length constraints leads to performance degradation and instability.\n* Balancing easy and hard problems in the training dataset improves initial reasoning performance and stabilizes model behavior, while cosine rewards effectively control output length, enhancing consistency.\n* The fine-tuned small LLMs achieved competitive reasoning performance, notably outperforming larger models on specific benchmarks like AIME24, at a fraction of the computational cost and data requirements of existing methods.\n* Insufficient output length constraints hinder the model's ability to handle extremely complex reasoning tasks, and the multilingual nature of base models can lead to language drift during training.\n* Future research should focus on longer training durations, adaptive length strategies, and explicit language control to further enhance the reasoning capabilities of small LLMs.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the efficacy of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under strict computational constraints. The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset for training a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Experiments revealed that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) within limited training steps using minimal data and at a low cost ($42). However, prolonged training led to performance degradation and optimization instability, particularly due to length constraints. Strategies like mixing easy and hard problems and employing cosine rewards helped stabilize training and control output length, though extending length limits was found necessary for extremely complex tasks. The study highlights the potential of RL for resource-constrained LLM reasoning, while also identifying limitations such as susceptibility to over-optimization and challenges with multilingual base models and insufficient output length capacity. Future work could address these by extending training, adjusting length strategies, and incorporating language controls.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) using RL with limited data (7,000 samples) and low cost ($42) within tight computational constraints.\n*   Prolonged training under strict output length constraints leads to performance degradation and optimization instability in small LLMs.\n*   Mixing easier problems with harder ones can improve initial performance and stabilize reasoning behavior, while cosine rewards help control output length.\n*   The maximum completion length (3584-4096 tokens) was insufficient for extremely hard problems, forcing premature truncation of reasoning processes.\n*   Future directions include extending training duration, implementing multi-stage length schedules, and addressing multilingual drift to fully unlock the potential of small LLMs for complex reasoning.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the impact of output length constraints on the stability and efficacy of training LLMs for complex reasoning tasks, specifically focusing on a 1.5-billion-parameter model using reinforcement learning (RL) under strict resource limitations. Experiment 1 showed that while small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains with high-quality data within initial training steps, prolonged training under strict length constraints leads to performance degradation and unstable outputs. Experiment 2 demonstrated that mixing easy and hard problems can improve early performance and stabilize reasoning behavior by encouraging more concise outputs, though long-term stability remains a challenge. Experiment 3 found that using a cosine reward to control output length enhances training consistency but that extending length limits is crucial for very hard tasks, especially with multilingual base models that can exhibit language drift. The overall comparison reveals that their approach, Open-RS, achieves competitive reasoning performance with significantly less data and cost compared to larger models and other small LLMs, even surpassing some benchmarks like AIME24. However, limitations include insufficient length constraints for extremely complex problems and potential language drift in multilingual models, highlighting the trade-offs between efficiency and reasoning depth.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Training small LLMs with RL for reasoning shows rapid initial gains but can lead to performance degradation and instability under prolonged training and strict output length constraints.\n*   Mixing easier problems with harder ones and using cosine rewards helps stabilize training and control output length, though extended length limits are still needed for complex reasoning.\n*   The proposed method (Open-RS) achieves competitive reasoning performance on mathematical tasks with significantly less data and cost ($42) compared to larger models and other small LLMs.\n*   Key limitations include the insufficiency of current length constraints for extremely difficult problems and the potential for language drift in multilingual base models.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the impact of output length constraints on training small LLMs for complex reasoning tasks, using reinforcement learning (RL) with the GRPO algorithm. The research found that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements with limited, high-quality data within the initial training steps. However, prolonged training under strict output length constraints led to performance degradation, unstable optimization, and unexpected behavior like language drift. Mixing easier problems with harder ones, combined with reduced length constraints, initially improved performance and stabilized reasoning. Employing a cosine reward to control output length further enhanced training consistency but required longer completion limits for extremely difficult tasks. The study demonstrates that RL-based fine-tuning can significantly enhance small LLMs' reasoning capabilities cost-effectively, achieving competitive results with minimal data and computational resources compared to larger models. Despite these successes, challenges related to optimization stability and effective management of output length for complex reasoning remain key areas for future research.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n* Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning gains quickly with limited, high-quality data, but prolonged training under strict length constraints leads to performance degradation.\n* Mixing easier and harder problems, along with reduced length constraints, initially stabilizes reasoning and improves performance in small LLMs.\n* Cosine rewards help control output length and improve training consistency, but extended length limits are necessary for highly complex reasoning tasks.\n* RL-based fine-tuning offers a cost-effective way to enhance small LLMs' reasoning abilities, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding larger models with significantly fewer resources.\n* Output length constraints and the multilingual nature of base models pose challenges to sustained reasoning performance and output consistency in small LLMs.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the impact of output length constraints on training small LLMs for complex reasoning tasks using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset to train a 1.5-billion-parameter model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) under strict resource constraints (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24-hour limit).\n\nExperiment 1 demonstrated that while small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 70%) within the first 50-100 steps with high-quality data, prolonged training under strict length constraints (4096 tokens) led to performance degradation and unstable outputs.\n\nExperiment 2, by mixing easy and hard problems and reducing the maximum completion length (3584 tokens), showed improved initial performance (AMC23 to 80%) and more stable reasoning, but long-term stability remained a challenge.\n\nExperiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to better control output length, stabilizing it between 1000-3500 tokens and improving training consistency, though it slightly reduced peak performance. The multilingual nature of the base model also presented challenges with language drift.\n\nOverall, the Open-RS models achieved competitive performance with minimal resources ($42 cost, 7,000 samples), outperforming other 1.5B models and some 7B models. Limitations include insufficient length for extremely hard problems and multilingual drift. Future directions involve extending training duration, implementing better language controls, and exploring hybrid methods.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   **Output length constraints significantly impact small LLM reasoning training:** Prolonged training under strict length limits leads to performance degradation and unstable outputs, while controlling length with cosine rewards improves consistency but can limit peak performance on complex tasks.\n*   **Early rapid gains vs. long-term instability:** Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements quickly (50-100 steps) with high-quality data, but maintaining this performance over longer training periods under constraints is challenging.\n*   **Data mix and reward design are crucial:** Mixing easy and hard problems stabilizes early reasoning, and cosine rewards effectively regulate output length, though the former offers higher peak performance.\n*   **Resource efficiency is achievable:** The study demonstrates that small LLMs can achieve competitive reasoning performance with significantly less data and cost ($42, 7,000 samples) compared to larger models and other small model approaches.\n*   **Multilingual base models pose challenges:** The multilingual nature of the base model led to language drift, highlighting the need for explicit language control mechanisms or monolingual base models for consistent English-only reasoning.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the efficacy of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small LLMs (1.5 billion parameters) under strict computational constraints, aiming to democratize advanced AI. The researchers adapted the GRPO algorithm and curated a high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset, training on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours. Experiment 1 showed rapid initial reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 70%) within 50-100 steps, but performance degraded with prolonged training due to length constraints and reward misalignment. Experiment 2, by mixing easy and hard problems and reducing length limits, achieved better early performance (AMC23 to 80%) but still faced late-stage instability. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to stabilize output lengths, improving consistency but sacrificing peak accuracy. Despite limitations like length constraints and multilingual base model drift, the approach achieved competitive performance (e.g., AIME24 46.7%) at a significantly lower cost ($42) than larger models, offering a scalable alternative. Future work could involve extending training, addressing language drift, and exploring hybrid methods.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning gains rapidly (within 50-100 steps) using RL and high-quality data under strict resource constraints.\n*   Prolonged training beyond initial gains can lead to performance degradation, particularly due to output length constraints and potential reward misalignment.\n*   Mixing easier problems with harder ones and using cosine rewards for length control can improve early performance and training stability, though full long-term stability remains a challenge.\n*   The study demonstrates a highly cost-effective approach ($42) for enhancing small LLM reasoning, achieving competitive results against larger models and surpassing specific benchmarks like AIME24 with o1-preview.\n*   Key limitations include insufficient length limits for very complex reasoning, and the multilingual nature of the base model causing language drift.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the impact of output length constraints on training small LLMs for complex reasoning tasks, utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) on a 1.5-billion-parameter model under strict resource limitations. Experiment 1 showed that while small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains with high-quality data (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 70%), prolonged training under strict length constraints (4096 tokens) leads to performance degradation and unstable outputs. Experiment 2, by mixing easy and hard problems and reducing the length constraint to 3584 tokens, improved initial performance (AMC23 to 80%) and stabilized behavior, but long-term stability remained an issue. Experiment 3, using a cosine reward to control output length, further stabilized lengths and training consistency but showed less peak performance, indicating a need for longer completion limits for harder tasks. Overall, the approach demonstrated competitive performance with minimal resources ($42 cost, 7000 samples), outperforming larger baselines on specific benchmarks like AIME24 (46.7% vs. o1-preview's 44.6%). Key limitations included truncation of reasoning due to length constraints and multilingual drift from the base model, suggesting future work on extended training, multi-stage length control, and language-specific constraints.\n\n2.

The researchers found that while RL can rapidly improve reasoning capabilities in small models (e.g., a 1.5B parameter model) with limited high-quality data and computational resources, prolonged training under strict length constraints leads to performance degradation and instability. Experiment 1 showed initial gains followed by a sharp decline after 200 steps due to length limitations and reward misalignment. Experiment 2, by mixing easy and hard problems and reducing length constraints, achieved better early performance but still suffered from late-stage instability. Experiment 3 demonstrated that cosine rewards effectively stabilize output lengths, improving consistency, but longer lengths are still needed for very complex tasks. Overall, the approach achieved competitive reasoning performance with significantly lower costs and data requirements than larger models, but highlighted challenges in managing output length and potential multilingual interference in small LLMs.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements with limited high-quality data within 50–100 steps, but performance degrades with prolonged training under strict length constraints.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems under reduced length constraints enhances early performance and stabilizes reasoning behavior, though long-term stability remains a challenge.\n*   Cosine rewards stabilize completion lengths, improving training consistency, but extending length limits is necessary for extremely hard tasks, especially with multilingual base models.\n*   The study demonstrates a cost-effective method to enhance small LLMs' reasoning, achieving performance comparable to larger models with significantly lower computational cost and data, but identifies output length control and potential language drift as key limitations.",

The research found that while RL-based fine-tuning can rapidly improve reasoning capabilities in small LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) with limited data and computational resources, it faces challenges with prolonged training and strict length constraints. Experiment 1 showed that initial gains were followed by performance degradation and unstable output due to exceeding length limits. Experiment 2, by mixing easy and hard problems with a reduced length limit, improved early performance and stability, but long-term stability remained an issue. Experiment 3 demonstrated that cosine rewards effectively controlled output length, leading to more consistent training, but longer lengths were still needed for very difficult problems. Overall, the study highlights that small LLMs can achieve competitive reasoning performance cost-effectively, but careful management of training duration, data composition, and length constraints is crucial for sustained efficacy.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements with limited high-quality data and RL within 50-100 training steps.\n*   Prolonged training under strict output length constraints can lead to performance degradation and instability in small LLMs.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems in the training data, coupled with reduced length constraints, enhances early performance and stabilizes reasoning.\n*   Cosine rewards are effective in controlling output length and improving training consistency, but may require longer completion lengths for extremely complex reasoning tasks.\n*   The study demonstrates cost-effective reasoning enhancement for small LLMs, achieving competitive performance with significantly less data and computational cost compared to larger models.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the impact of output length constraints on training small LLMs for complex reasoning tasks using reinforcement learning (RL). The research found that while RL-based fine-tuning can rapidly improve reasoning capabilities in small LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) with limited data and computational resources, it faces challenges with prolonged training and strict length constraints. Experiment 1 showed that initial gains were followed by performance degradation and unstable output due to exceeding length limits. Experiment 2, by mixing easy and hard problems with a reduced length limit, improved early performance and stability, but long-term stability remained an issue. Experiment 3 demonstrated that cosine rewards effectively controlled output length, leading to more consistent training, but longer lengths were still needed for very difficult problems. Overall, the study highlights that small LLMs can achieve competitive reasoning performance cost-effectively, but careful management of training duration, data composition, and length constraints is crucial for sustained efficacy.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements with limited high-quality data and RL within 50-100 training steps.\n*   Prolonged training under strict output length constraints can lead to performance degradation and instability in small LLMs.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems in the training data, coupled with reduced length constraints, enhances early performance and stabilizes reasoning.\n*   Cosine rewards are effective in controlling output length and improving training consistency, but may require longer completion lengths for extremely complex reasoning tasks.\n*   The study demonstrates cost-effective reasoning enhancement for small LLMs, achieving competitive performance with significantly less data and computational cost compared to larger models.",
