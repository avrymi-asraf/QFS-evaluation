SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance by distilling knowledge from multiple larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher embedding models. The core of this distillation process is a novel multi-stage framework. This framework employs three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss for absolute representation alignment, similarity loss for semantic matching between text pairs, and relative similarity distillation loss for learning ranking preferences. This distillation approach allows a smaller student model to learn from the strengths of larger models without requiring supervised data, relying instead on unsupervised text. The process is further enhanced by using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model. Additionally, a self-distillation mechanism is used in the final stage to align visual embeddings with textual embeddings, enabling multimodal capabilities. Jasper's performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) is comparable to models with 7 billion parameters, significantly outperforming other models in its size class.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper utilizes a multi-stage distillation framework to transfer knowledge from multiple SOTA teacher embedding models to a smaller student model.\n*   Three specific loss functions (cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss) are employed to guide the distillation process from absolute to relative representations.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is used for effective dimensionality reduction of the student model's embeddings.\n*   A self-distillation mechanism is implemented to align visual and textual embeddings, facilitating multimodal capabilities.\n*   Jasper achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of this distillation approach.",

Stage 4 specifically focuses on unlocking multimodal potential by aligning visual and textual embeddings. This stage employs a self-distillation approach where caption embeddings serve as teacher vectors for image embeddings, acting as student vectors. Key components involved in this process include the visual encoder (trained) and previously introduced fully connected layers (used to generate student/teacher vector pairs). The goal is to achieve a preliminary alignment between text and image modalities, though the paper acknowledges significant room for improvement. The loss function behavior in Stage 4 exhibited oscillatory patterns, and limitations include a basic image encoding capability due to resource constraints, with future work planned to enhance multimodal training, potentially through contrastive learning.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Stage 4 of Jasper's training uses self-distillation to align image embeddings (student) with text embeddings (teacher) from captions.\n*   During Stage 4, the visual encoder is trained while other components are frozen.\n*   The loss function in Stage 4 showed oscillatory behavior, and the multimodal alignment is considered preliminary.\n*   Limitations in Stage 4 stem from resource constraints, leading to basic image encoding, with potential for future improvements via contrastive learning.",

The core of Jasper's training is a multi-stage distillation framework that leverages multiple SOTA teacher models. Three carefully designed loss functions—cosine loss (Lcosine), similarity loss (Lsim), and relative similarity distillation loss (Lresim)—are employed to transfer knowledge from teachers to the student. Lcosine aligns absolute representations, Lsim ensures consistent semantic judgment between text pairs, and Lresim captures relative ranking preferences. Stage 3 focuses on dimension reduction using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL), introducing fully connected layers to create lower-dimensional outputs from a 12288-dimensional concatenated teacher vector. A self-distillation approach is proposed here, where earlier student outputs act as teachers for reduced dimensions. Stage 4 aims for multimodal alignment by using image-caption pairs, treating caption embeddings as teacher vectors for image embeddings. The Jasper model, built upon Stella, demonstrates robustness to instructions and achieves an average MTEB score of 71.54 across 56 datasets, ranking third on the leaderboard.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper utilizes a 4-stage distillation process with Lcosine, Lsim, and Lresim loss functions to distill knowledge from multiple large teacher models.\n*   Stage 3 employs MRL for dimension reduction, proposing a self-distillation method where intermediate student outputs serve as teachers for compressed representations.\n*   Stage 4 initiates multimodal alignment using image-caption pairs, with caption embeddings acting as teacher signals for image embeddings.\n*   Jasper achieves a 71.54 average score on MTEB, demonstrating performance comparable to 7B models despite being a 2B model.\n*   The model architecture combines a language model and a vision encoder, with fully connected layers for projection and dimension reduction.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, built upon the Stella model, that achieves state-of-the-art performance at its scale and rivals 7 billion parameter models on the MTEB benchmark. The core of Jasper's development lies in a novel multi-stage distillation framework designed to transfer knowledge from multiple larger teacher embedding models. This framework utilizes three loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss, to progressively align the student model's representations with those of the teachers. To address the challenge of high vector dimensionality in leading models, Jasper incorporates Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for effective dimension reduction. A key aspect of this work, particularly relevant to your query, is Stage 4, which focuses on unlocking multimodal potential through self-distillation for preliminary alignment between visual and textual embeddings. In this stage, image-caption pairs are used, with the caption's embedding acting as the teacher and the image's embedding as the student. While this stage demonstrates a promising approach to modality alignment, the paper acknowledges limitations in vision encoding, citing resource constraints and suggesting future work for further refinement. The Jasper model's architecture integrates a language model and a vision encoder, with a pooler to unify their representations.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model built upon Stella, that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MTEB benchmark, comparable to much larger 7B parameter models. The core of Jasper's training is a multi-stage distillation framework designed to transfer knowledge from multiple large teacher embedding models. This process utilizes three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss, which progressively align student and teacher representations from specific to broader semantic relationships. To address the challenge of high vector dimensionality in large teacher models, Jasper incorporates Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for effective dimension reduction. A key aspect of the framework is Stage 4, which unlocks multimodal potential through self-distillation for modality alignment. Here, the caption's vector representation serves as the teacher, and the image's vector representation acts as the student, enabling a preliminary alignment between text and visual modalities.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a multi-stage distillation framework using cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss to learn from multiple large teacher models.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is used to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model.\n*   Stage 4 of the training process focuses on unlocking multimodal potential through self-distillation for aligning visual and textual embeddings.\n*   Jasper, a 2B parameter model, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark, securing the No. 3 position.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model that leverages a multi-stage distillation framework to learn from larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models. The core of the approach is a knowledge distillation process involving three carefully designed losses: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. These losses progressively transfer knowledge from teacher models to the student, moving from specific to broader semantic alignment. To manage the high dimensionality resulting from distilling multiple teachers, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed for effective vector dimensionality reduction. Stage 4 focuses on unlocking multimodal potential through self-distillation, aligning visual embeddings with textual embeddings using image-caption pairs. This stage uses the text embeddings as teacher signals for the image embeddings, serving as a preliminary step for visual-textual alignment. Despite its smaller size, Jasper achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard. The authors acknowledge limitations in the vision encoding stage, attributing it to resource constraints and suggesting future work for further multimodal enhancement.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a multi-stage knowledge distillation framework using cosine, similarity, and relative similarity losses to transfer knowledge from multiple SOTA teacher models.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model after distillation.\n*   Stage 4 incorporates self-distillation for preliminary modality alignment, using text embeddings as teacher signals for image embeddings.\n*   The Jasper model, with 2B parameters, demonstrates performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark.\n*   Limitations in the vision encoding stage are noted, with potential for future improvements in multimodal training.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art performance by distilling knowledge from multiple larger teacher models. The core of their approach is a multi-stage distillation framework utilizing three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss (aligning absolute representations), similarity loss (semantic discrepancies from a text-pair perspective), and relative similarity distillation loss (leveraging ranking information). To address the high dimensionality of concatenated teacher embeddings, they employ Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) in Stage 3, which also includes a self-distillation mechanism where earlier student embeddings act as teachers for reduced-dimensionality vectors. Stage 4 unlocks multimodal potential through self-distillation, aligning image embeddings with text embeddings using caption data. Jasper's architecture combines a language model and a vision encoder, with the latter being trained in Stage 4. The Jasper model, built upon Stella, achieved the No.3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating comparable performance to 7B parameter models while significantly outperforming models under 2B parameters. The research also highlights Jasper's robustness to different instructions.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper employs a multi-stage distillation process using cosine, similarity, and relative similarity losses to transfer knowledge from larger teacher models.\n*   Stage 3 utilizes Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for dimension reduction and incorporates self-distillation by using internal student embeddings as teachers.\n*   Stage 4 focuses on multimodal alignment through self-distillation, training the vision encoder using image-caption pairs.\n*   Jasper (2B parameters) achieved No.3 on the MTEB leaderboard, rivaling 7B models and outperforming smaller models.\n*   The Jasper model demonstrates robustness to various instructions, indicating reliable performance across different prompting strategies.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a 2 billion parameter embedding model, developed using a multi-stage distillation framework to learn from multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) teacher models. The distillation process employs three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss, moving from specific to broader semantic alignment. To address the high dimensionality of concatenated teacher embeddings, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized for effective dimension reduction. Stage 4 focuses on multimodal capabilities through self-distillation, aligning visual and textual embeddings, though this aspect is noted as preliminary. Jasper achieves a competitive No.3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, with performance comparable to larger 7B parameter models. The model also demonstrates robustness to different instructions. Future work aims to enhance multimodal alignment and explore other improvements.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Jasper utilizes a multi-stage distillation framework with three distinct loss functions (cosine, similarity, relative similarity) to transfer knowledge from larger teacher models.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed for effective dimensionality reduction of the student embedding model's output.\n*   Jasper achieves a high ranking on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating performance comparable to larger models despite its smaller parameter count.\n*   The model shows robustness to variations in input instructions.\n*   Stage 4 introduces a preliminary self-distillation approach for multimodal alignment, with potential for future enhancements.",
