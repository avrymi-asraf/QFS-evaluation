SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the impact of pre-trained latent abilities on Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), even with low-quality or \"spurious\" reward signals. The research found that models like Qwen2.5-Math, which possess strong pre-trained \"code reasoning\" abilities (i.e., generating Python code to assist in problem-solving without actual execution), demonstrate significant performance improvements in mathematical tasks when subjected to RLVR, irrespective of the reward signal's quality. This improvement is attributed to RLVR's ability to elicit and amplify these pre-existing latent reasoning strategies. For instance, Qwen2.5-Math-7B's code reasoning frequency increased from 65% to over 90% after RLVR, even with random or incorrect rewards, correlating directly with accuracy gains. In contrast, other model families lacking this pre-trained code reasoning capability showed minimal to no improvement with the same spurious rewards. This highlights that the effectiveness of RLVR, particularly with weak signals, is heavily dependent on the model's inherent pre-trained abilities, rather than solely on the quality of the reward signal itself.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can significantly improve model performance even with spurious reward signals (e.g., random or incorrect rewards), provided the model possesses relevant pre-trained latent abilities.\n*   The \"code reasoning\" ability, characterized by generating Python code for problem-solving without execution, is a key pre-trained latent ability that makes Qwen2.5-Math models highly receptive to RLVR with spurious rewards.\n*   Spurious rewards amplify existing reasoning patterns. For Qwen2.5-Math, this leads to increased code reasoning frequency and improved accuracy, whereas models lacking such patterns do not benefit.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with weak or spurious rewards is model-dependent, underscoring the influence of pre-training on downstream RL outcomes.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse models to account for differing pre-trained abilities and their impact on RL outcomes.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its effectiveness, particularly with \"spurious\" or weak reward signals, across different language model families. The core finding is that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning, even when the reward signal is poorly correlated with the correct answer. This improvement is not due to the reward signal itself teaching new capabilities, but rather due to RLVR's ability to surface and upweight latent reasoning abilities already present in the pretrained model. A prime example is \"code reasoning\" – generating Python code to aid mathematical thought, even without execution – which is a strong latent ability in Qwen2.5-Math models. When this ability is present and correlated with correctness, RLVR, even with spurious rewards, can substantially boost performance. However, this effect is highly model-dependent; models like Llama and OLMo, lacking strong pre-trained code reasoning, do not benefit from these spurious rewards and may even degrade. The research emphasizes that RLVR findings on one model family, like Qwen, may not generalize, and future RLVR research should be validated on diverse models and reward types.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can elicit significant performance gains in mathematical reasoning even with weak or spurious reward signals, primarily by surfacing latent pre-trained abilities.\n*   \"Code reasoning\" (generating Python code for thought processes) is a key latent ability in Qwen2.5-Math models that RLVR effectively upweights, leading to performance improvements.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; models lacking the specific latent abilities (like code reasoning) do not benefit and may even degrade.\n*   Research findings from RLVR on one model family (e.g., Qwen) may not generalize to others, necessitating validation across diverse models and reward signals.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates how a model's pre-trained latent abilities influence reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), even when the reward signals are weak or spurious. The research found that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance in certain models, like Qwen2.5-Math, even with random or incorrect rewards. This improvement is attributed to RLVR surfacing pre-existing reasoning capabilities learned during pretraining, rather than teaching new ones. For instance, Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit strong \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for thought processes without execution), which RLVR amplifies, leading to substantial accuracy gains. Crucially, these spurious rewards are model-dependent; they largely fail to improve performance in other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, suggesting that the effectiveness of RLVR with weak signals is tied to the specific latent abilities the base model possesses from its pretraining. The study emphasizes the need to validate RLVR research on diverse models due to these differing pre-training priors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve significant performance gains in mathematical reasoning even with spurious reward signals (e.g., random, incorrect labels).\n*   These gains are largely due to RLVR surfacing and amplifying latent reasoning abilities acquired during pretraining, particularly \"code reasoning\" in Qwen2.5-Math models.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; they work for Qwen2.5-Math but generally fail for other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, indicating the importance of pre-trained latent abilities.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse models to account for differences in pre-training priors and their impact on RLVR outcomes.",

SUMMARY:\n\nThis research investigates how pre-trained latent abilities influence reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), particularly when reward signals are weak or spurious. The study demonstrates that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models even with rewards that are random, incorrectly labeled, or only format-based. These spurious rewards yield performance gains comparable to ground truth rewards. However, this effectiveness is highly model-dependent, with other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2 showing minimal or no improvement. The key factor identified is \"code reasoning\"—the ability to think in Python without execution—which is prevalent in Qwen2.5-Math models and is significantly up-weighted by RLVR, even with spurious rewards. This suggests RLVR primarily surfaces pre-existing capabilities. The paper also highlights the sensitivity of models to prompts, showing that even irrelevant prompts can sometimes boost performance, and that the GRPO algorithm's clipping mechanism can create training signals from random rewards by amplifying existing behaviors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n*   RLVR can achieve substantial performance gains in mathematical reasoning using weak or spurious rewards (random, incorrect format) on Qwen2.5-Math models.\n*   These gains are largely attributed to RLVR eliciting and amplifying pre-existing latent abilities, such as \"code reasoning\" (thinking with Python code without execution), which becomes significantly more frequent in Qwen2.5-Math models.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; they work for Qwen2.5 models but generally fail for other families like Llama3 and OLMo2, indicating pretraining plays a crucial role.\n*   Model performance is sensitive to prompts, with even task-irrelevant \"spurious prompts\" sometimes leading to improved outcomes.\n*   The GRPO algorithm's clipping mechanism can inadvertently create training signals from random rewards by biasing the model towards its pre-existing, high-probability behaviors.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates how pretrained latent abilities influence Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), even with low-quality reward signals. The study finds that \"spurious rewards\" (e.g., random, incorrect, or format-based rewards) can significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance in certain models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math. This improvement is attributed to RLVR's ability to elicit pre-existing reasoning strategies, such as \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code to assist in problem-solving without actual execution). Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong propensity for code reasoning, which correlates with higher accuracy and is amplified by RLVR, even with flawed rewards. Conversely, other model families like Llama and OLMo2 do not show similar gains with spurious rewards, suggesting their pretrained latent abilities are different or less amenable to elicitation. The GRPO clipping bias is identified as a mechanism that can create training signals from random rewards by favoring existing high-probability behaviors, thus amplifying these pretrained abilities. The research also highlights that prompt sensitivity can influence performance and that RLVR's effectiveness is highly model-dependent, urging for broader validation beyond single model families.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Spurious rewards (random, incorrect, format) can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in models like Qwen2.5-Math, even without accurate reward signals.\n*   This improvement is largely driven by RLVR eliciting and amplifying pretrained latent abilities, notably \"code reasoning\" (using Python for mathematical thought processes).\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; Qwen2.5-Math benefits due to its strong pretrained code reasoning capabilities, while other models do not.\n*   The GRPO algorithm's clipping bias can create artificial training signals from random rewards by reinforcing existing, high-probability behaviors.\n*   Model sensitivity to prompts can also influence performance, and RLVR effectiveness is not universal across different model architectures.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its reliance on latent abilities within language models, particularly focusing on the Qwen2.5-Math models. Counterintuitively, the research demonstrates that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance even with weak or entirely spurious reward signals (e.g., random, incorrect labels, or format-based rewards). These spurious rewards yield performance gains comparable to ground truth rewards on Qwen2.5-Math models. However, this effectiveness does not generalize to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, suggesting that the specific pre-trained latent abilities of a model play a crucial role. For Qwen2.5-Math, the paper identifies \"code reasoning\"—generating Python code to aid mathematical thinking without actual execution—as a key latent ability that RLVR upweights, leading to substantial performance improvements. This highlights that RLVR can surface and amplify pre-existing reasoning strategies, rather than teaching entirely new ones, when the reward signal is weak. The study also delves into the mechanism of GRPO's clipping bias, suggesting it can create training signals from noisy rewards by favoring existing model behaviors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve significant performance gains even with spurious reward signals (random, incorrect labels, format-based) on Qwen2.5-Math models, often matching ground truth rewards.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards in RLVR is highly model-dependent; these rewards fail to generalize to models like Llama3 or OLMo2.\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models exhibit a strong latent ability for \"code reasoning\" (generating Python for mathematical thought), which RLVR effectively upweights, correlating with improved performance.\n*   The GRPO optimization algorithm's clipping bias may contribute to the effectiveness of spurious rewards by favoring and amplifying pre-existing model behaviors.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse models, not just Qwen, due to the observed model-specific sensitivities.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with spurious or weak reward signals, particularly focusing on how a model's pretrained latent abilities influence outcomes. The research demonstrates that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models even with rewards that have little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer. This is attributed to RLVR's ability to surface and upweight pre-existing reasoning strategies learned during pretraining, such as \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for mathematical thought processes). Crucially, these spurious rewards are highly model-dependent; they work effectively for Qwen models but fail to yield gains on other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, suggesting that differences in pretraining data and learned behaviors are key. The paper also explores the role of GRPO's clipping bias in generating training signals from random rewards by reinforcing pre-existing, high-probability behaviors. The authors recommend future RLVR research be validated on diverse models and highlight that existing methods may overstate gains due to a Qwen-centric bias.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can achieve substantial performance gains in mathematical reasoning even with weak or entirely spurious reward signals, particularly on Qwen2.5-Math models.\n*   These gains are largely attributed to RLVR surfacing and amplifying latent reasoning abilities acquired during pretraining, such as \"code reasoning,\" which correlates with higher accuracy for Qwen models.\n*   The effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; they work for Qwen models but not for others like Llama3 or OLMo2, indicating that pretraining influences RLVR outcomes.\n*   The GRPO optimization algorithm's clipping bias can create a meaningful training signal from random rewards by favoring and reinforcing a model's pre-existing, high-probability behaviors.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse model architectures and families, as observed effects may not generalize beyond Qwen models.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with spurious reward signals, particularly how a model's pre-trained latent abilities influence outcomes regardless of reward quality. The research demonstrates that RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models even with weak or incorrect reward signals, achieving gains comparable to ground truth rewards. This effect is not generalizable to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2, which show minimal or no improvement. The study identifies \"code reasoning\"—generating Python code to aid mathematical thinking without execution—as a distinctive latent ability of Qwen2.5-Math models. RLVR, especially with spurious rewards, appears to upweight this pre-existing code reasoning capability, leading to performance gains. The paper also explores how the GRPO optimization algorithm's clipping bias can create a training signal from random rewards by amplifying existing model priors, explaining the Qwen2.5-Math model's success. It concludes by emphasizing the need for diverse model validation in RLVR research and highlights that pre-trained latent abilities are crucial determinants of RLVR success, even with flawed rewards.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR with spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels) can significantly boost Qwen2.5-Math model performance, often matching gains from ground truth rewards.\n*   This effectiveness of spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; Qwen2.5-Math models benefit, while Llama3 and OLMo2 models do not.\n*   The paper identifies \"code reasoning\" as a latent ability in Qwen2.5-Math models that RLVR, particularly with spurious rewards, effectively upweights, leading to performance improvements.\n*   The GRPO algorithm's clipping bias can generate a training signal from random rewards by exploiting pre-trained latent abilities, explaining why certain models benefit from even uninformative rewards.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse model families, as pre-trained latent capabilities heavily influence the outcomes of RLVR, irrespective of reward signal quality.",

SUMMARY:\nThis research investigates how pre-trained latent abilities influence Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly when reward signals are weak or spurious. The study reveals that models like Qwen2.5-Math, which exhibit strong pre-trained \"code reasoning\" (generating Python code for mathematical thought processes without execution), can achieve significant performance gains on tasks like MATH-500 even with random or incorrect rewards. This improvement is attributed to RLVR eliciting these latent abilities. In contrast, other model families, such as Llama and OLMo, show minimal or no gains with spurious rewards, indicating that their pre-trained reasoning strategies are not as readily surfaced by RLVR. The study also delves into the GRPO algorithm's clipping bias, suggesting it can inadvertently provide a training signal by favoring pre-existing high-probability behaviors, which, in the case of Qwen2.5-Math, are beneficial code reasoning patterns. This highlights the critical importance of model-specific pre-training and the need to validate RLVR findings across diverse model architectures.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Qwen2.5-Math models show substantial performance gains with spurious rewards (e.g., random, incorrect labels) by leveraging their pre-trained \"code reasoning\" ability.\n*   Other model families (Llama, OLMo) do not benefit from spurious rewards, indicating that the effectiveness of RLVR is heavily dependent on the model's pre-trained latent abilities.\n*   The GRPO algorithm's clipping bias may amplify existing behaviors, and for Qwen2.5-Math, this amplification of code reasoning leads to performance improvements even with uninformative rewards.\n*   The study emphasizes that RLVR primarily surfaces and upweights pre-existing reasoning strategies rather than teaching entirely new ones.\n*   Researchers are cautioned to test RLVR methods on diverse models, as findings on one family (like Qwen) may not generalize.",

The study highlights that for the Qwen2.5-Math model family, RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance even with rewards that have little to no correlation with the correct answer. This improvement is attributed to RLVR's ability to surface and upweight latent reasoning abilities acquired during pretraining, rather than teaching new capabilities. A key finding is that \"code reasoning\" – generating Python code to aid mathematical thought processes without actual execution – is a prominent pretrained ability in Qwen2.5-Math models that RLVR effectively elicits. This behavior strongly correlates with improved accuracy. Crucially, these positive results with spurious rewards do not generalize to other model families like Llama or OLMo, suggesting that the specific pretrained latent abilities of a model are a critical determinant of RLVR's success, irrespective of reward signal quality. The paper also touches upon the GRPO clipping bias as a potential mechanism through which random rewards can provide training signals by favoring existing model priors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RLVR can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models even with spurious or weak reward signals.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is strongly linked to the model's pretrained latent abilities, such as \"code reasoning\" in Qwen2.5-Math.\n*   These positive findings with spurious rewards do not generalize to other model families (e.g., Llama, OLMo), indicating model-specific pretrained capabilities are key.\n*   The GRPO clipping bias might explain how random rewards can provide training signals by leveraging existing model behaviors.\n*   Future RLVR research should be validated on diverse models, not just Qwen, due to the observed model-specific behavior.",
