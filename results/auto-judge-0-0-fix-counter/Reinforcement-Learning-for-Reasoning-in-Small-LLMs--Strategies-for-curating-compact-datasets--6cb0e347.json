SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates strategies for curating compact datasets to enhance Reinforcement Learning (RL) training efficiency in small LLMs, particularly under resource constraints. The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and focused on a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. They experimented with different dataset compositions and reward mechanisms to balance problem difficulty and optimize training. Key findings indicate that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains with limited, high-quality data (e.g., 7,000 samples) and minimal computational cost ($42). For instance, AMC23 accuracy improved from 63% to 80%, and AIME24 reached 46.7%, surpassing a strong baseline. However, challenges like optimization instability and length constraints emerged with prolonged training. The study highlights that mixing easy and hard problems and using cosine rewards for length control can improve early performance and training stability. These findings offer a cost-effective alternative to resource-intensive approaches for developing reasoning-capable small LLMs.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) using RL with a compact dataset (7,000 samples) and minimal resources ($42 cost).\n*   Curating datasets by balancing problem difficulty (mixing easy and hard problems) enhances early performance and stabilizes reasoning behavior in small LLMs.\n*   Cosine rewards effectively control output length, improving training consistency, although longer completion lengths may be needed for extremely hard tasks.\n*   The approach demonstrates a cost-effective and data-efficient method for enhancing LLM reasoning, providing a viable alternative for resource-constrained environments.\n*   Challenges include optimization instability and length constraints during prolonged training, as well as potential language drift in multilingual base models.",

The study focuses on a 1.5B parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, trained on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours. By adapting the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curating a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset of 7,000 samples, the researchers achieved significant reasoning improvements. For instance, AMC23 accuracy increased from 63% to 80%, and AIME24 reached 46.7%, outperforming baselines like o1-preview. This was accomplished with a minimal training cost of $42. The experiments revealed that while small LLMs can gain reasoning abilities rapidly with limited high-quality data, prolonged training can lead to performance degradation and instability, especially under length constraints. Balancing easy and hard problems and employing cosine rewards helped stabilize training and control output length. The findings highlight RL's cost-effectiveness and efficiency for small LLMs, offering a scalable alternative to resource-intensive approaches.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates strategies for curating compact, high-quality datasets to enhance reinforcement learning (RL) training efficiency in small LLMs under resource constraints. The research focuses on a 1.5B parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, trained on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours. By adapting the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and carefully curating mathematical reasoning datasets, the study aimed to balance problem difficulty and optimize training. Results demonstrate that small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning gains with minimal data (7,000 samples) and cost (~$42), with models like Open-RS3 achieving 46.7% on AIME24, surpassing o1-preview. However, limitations such as optimization instability and length constraints emerged with prolonged training, highlighting trade-offs. The research emphasizes that while compact datasets and efficient RL methods are effective, careful dataset curation (mixing easy and hard problems) and reward design (e.g., cosine reward for length control) are crucial for maximizing performance and stability within resource limitations. The findings provide a practical framework for developing reasoning-capable LLMs in resource-constrained environments.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A compact dataset of 7,000 mathematical reasoning samples, balanced for difficulty, was used to train a 1.5B parameter LLM with GRPO, achieving significant reasoning improvements under strict resource constraints (4x A40 GPUs, 24 hours).\n*   The curated dataset and efficient RL approach resulted in a training cost of approximately $42, significantly lower than baseline models, demonstrating a cost-effective strategy for enhancing small LLM reasoning.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems in the dataset, along with a cosine reward function to control output length, proved effective in stabilizing training and improving early performance, though long-term stability and handling extremely complex problems within length limits remain challenges.\n*   The study highlights that while small LLMs can achieve competitive reasoning performance (e.g., 46.7% on AIME24) with minimal data, limitations like optimization instability and multilingual drift necessitate careful consideration of dataset composition and reward mechanisms.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis study explores strategies for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small LLMs under resource constraints by curating compact datasets and employing reinforcement learning (RL). The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and focused on a 1.5B parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, trained on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours. A key dataset curation strategy involved balancing easy and hard problems, which, combined with a cosine reward function to control output length, led to significant initial reasoning gains. Experiment 2, using a 7000-sample dataset with mixed difficulty, improved AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80% within 50-100 steps. Experiment 3, incorporating a cosine reward, stabilized completion lengths to 1000-3500 tokens, enhancing training consistency. Overall, the resulting Open-RS models achieved competitive performance, with Open-RS3 reaching 46.7% on AIME24, surpassing o1-preview. Crucially, this was achieved with a training cost of $42 and only 7,000 samples, dramatically outperforming baselines that used significantly more data and thousands of dollars. However, limitations include performance degradation with prolonged training and multilingual drift from the base model, highlighting the challenges of length constraints and base model characteristics.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Balancing a compact dataset with a mix of easy and hard mathematical reasoning problems significantly improved early reasoning performance in a small LLM.\n*   Utilizing a cosine reward function effectively stabilized output completion lengths, leading to more consistent training.\n*   The proposed RL approach achieved competitive reasoning performance (e.g., 46.7% on AIME24) with minimal data (7,000 samples) and a low training cost ($42), demonstrating high efficiency for resource-constrained settings.\n*   Limitations were observed in performance degradation with prolonged training and multilingual drift from the base model, indicating challenges with strict length constraints and inherent model characteristics.",

The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and meticulously curated a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset. Experiment 1 demonstrated that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 70%) within 50-100 steps using high-quality data, but prolonged training leads to performance degradation. Experiment 2 showed that balancing easy and hard problems, along with reduced length constraints, further improved early performance (AMC23 to 80%) and stabilized reasoning, though long-term stability remained a challenge. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to control output length, improving consistency but slightly reducing peak performance. Critically, the approach achieved notable gains (AIME24 to 46.7%) with significantly less data (7,000 samples) and a drastically lower cost ($42) compared to larger models and previous efforts. This highlights the efficiency and scalability of RL for small LLMs in resource-limited settings.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) through RL fine-tuning with limited, high-quality data and computational resources.\n*   Balancing problem difficulty in the dataset and employing cosine rewards for length control are effective strategies for stabilizing and improving early reasoning performance.\n*   The proposed RL approach achieved state-of-the-art results for 1.5B models on AIME24 (46.7%), surpassing even larger models like o1-preview, with drastically reduced data (7,000 samples) and training costs ($42).\n*   Dataset curation involved filtering general reasoning datasets for mathematical content and using LLMs to remove trivial or noisy examples, resulting in a refined, compact corpus.\n*   The method demonstrates exceptional cost and data efficiency, costing only $42 and using 7,000 samples, compared to thousands of dollars and tens or hundreds of thousands of samples for baseline models.",

The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset. They experimented with a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours. Experiment 1 showed rapid initial gains with high-quality data but performance degradation with prolonged training. Experiment 2, by balancing easy and hard problems, improved early performance and stabilized reasoning, though long-term stability was still an issue. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to control output length, improving consistency but requiring longer completion limits for complex tasks. Overall, their approach achieved competitive reasoning performance (e.g., 46.7% on AIME24) with significantly reduced costs ($42) and data (7,000 samples) compared to larger models. The study highlights RL's viability for small LLMs in resource-constrained settings, while noting challenges like optimization instability and length constraints.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) using RL with compact, high-quality datasets (7,000 samples) and minimal resources (4x A40 GPUs, 24h, $42 cost).\n*   Balancing easy and hard problems in the dataset enhances initial reasoning performance and stabilizes training behavior for small LLMs.\n*   Cosine rewards effectively control output length, improving training consistency, but longer completion limits are needed for complex tasks.\n*   The research demonstrates a cost-effective ($42 vs. thousands) and data-efficient alternative to large-scale methods for enhancing LLM reasoning, despite challenges with optimization stability and length constraints.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates strategies for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The research focuses on a 1.5B parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, trained on limited hardware within a 24-hour window. The core strategy involves curating compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning datasets and adapting the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. Experiment 1 demonstrated that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 70%) with high-quality data in early training stages, but prolonged training led to performance degradation due to length constraints. Experiment 2 showed that balancing easy and hard problems, along with reduced length constraints, improved initial performance and stabilized behavior. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to control output length, enhancing consistency but slightly reducing peak performance. Overall, the developed \"Open-RS\" models achieved competitive reasoning scores, notably outperforming larger models on specific benchmarks like AIME24, while utilizing significantly fewer computational resources and data, costing only $42. The study confirms the efficacy of RL for small LLMs under resource constraints, while highlighting challenges like optimization instability and the need for careful dataset curation and reward design.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n* Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements with compact, high-quality datasets and RL, even under severe resource limitations (e.g., 4 GPUs, 24 hours).\n* Balancing problem difficulty in the curated dataset and using cosine rewards for length control are effective strategies for stabilizing RL training and improving performance.\n* The proposed method achieved competitive reasoning scores with minimal data (7,000 samples) and a low training cost ($42), outperforming larger models on certain benchmarks.\n* Key challenges identified include optimization instability and performance degradation with prolonged training due to length constraints and the inherent multilingual nature of the base model.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study explores Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies for enhancing reasoning in small LLMs (1.5B parameters) under severe resource constraints (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24 hours). The research focuses on curating compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning datasets and adapting the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. Experiment 1 showed rapid reasoning gains within 50-100 steps using a high-quality dataset, but performance degraded with prolonged training due to length constraints. Experiment 2, by mixing easy and hard problems and reducing length limits, further improved early performance and stabilized behavior. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to control output length, leading to more consistent training but slightly lower peak performance. The overall comparison reveals that the developed \"Open-RS\" models achieve competitive reasoning scores, even surpassing some larger models on specific benchmarks like AIME24, while utilizing significantly less data and incurring drastically lower training costs ($42 vs. thousands for baselines). This demonstrates the feasibility of RL-based fine-tuning for creating cost-effective, reasoning-capable small LLMs.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%, AIME24 to 46.7%) using RL and compact datasets within strict resource limits.\n*   Curating a dataset balancing problem difficulty and employing a cosine reward for length control are key strategies for stabilizing RL training in small LLMs.\n*   The proposed approach achieved competitive reasoning performance with minimal data (7,000 samples) and a remarkably low training cost of $42, drastically outperforming resource-intensive baselines.\n*   The study highlights trade-offs between training duration, dataset composition, and reward functions for optimizing reasoning in resource-constrained environments.\n*   The research successfully demonstrates that RL-based fine-tuning offers a cost-effective and scalable alternative to traditional large-scale methods for enhancing LLM reasoning.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates strategies for curating compact, high-quality datasets to enhance reinforcement learning (RL) training efficiency for small LLMs under resource constraints. The research focuses on a 1.5B parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, trained on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours. The methodology involves adapting the GRPO algorithm and carefully curating mathematical reasoning datasets. Experiment 1 demonstrated that while initial reasoning gains are rapid with high-quality data, prolonged training leads to performance degradation due to strict length constraints. Experiment 2 showed that balancing easy and hard problems with reduced length limits improves early performance and stabilizes behavior, though long-term stability remains a challenge. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to control output length, enhancing consistency but requiring longer completion limits for complex tasks. The resulting Open-RS models achieved competitive reasoning performance (e.g., 46.7% on AIME24) with significantly lower data and computational costs ($42 vs. thousands), outperforming other 1.5B models and rivaling some 7B models. Key limitations include the insufficient length constraints for very hard problems and the multilingual nature of the base model causing language drift.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Curating compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning datasets is crucial for efficient RL training of small LLMs under resource constraints.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems in the dataset, coupled with reduced length constraints, improves initial reasoning performance and training stability.\n*   Cosine rewards effectively control output length, enhancing training consistency, but longer completion limits are needed for complex tasks.\n*   The proposed approach significantly reduces data and computational costs (e.g., $42 training cost) while achieving competitive reasoning performance, outperforming other 1.5B models and rivaling some 7B models.\n*   Limitations include performance degradation with prolonged training under strict length constraints and potential language drift from multilingual base models.",
