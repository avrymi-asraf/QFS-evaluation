      "summary": "SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces \"reflective augmentation\" (RefAug), a novel training technique for language models (LMs) designed to improve their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the training dataset with more problems, RefAug enriches each training instance by appending a \"reflection\" section to the original solution. This reflection comprises two parts: alternative reasoning (exploring different problem-solving approaches) and follow-up reasoning (generalizing the problem or applying it to new contexts). The goal is to foster a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and methodologies, moving beyond simple pattern matching. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance on standard single-round math reasoning tasks and, crucially, excels in more complex reflective reasoning scenarios like error correction and multi-turn problem-solving, where traditional methods fall short. RefAug also proves complementary to existing augmentation techniques, leading to further performance gains.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LM mathematical reasoning by embedding alternative and follow-up reasoning into training data.\n*   This method improves performance on both basic single-round math problems and complex reflective reasoning tasks.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, yielding synergistic benefits.\n*   The approach trains LMs to understand principles and apply them flexibly, rather than just memorizing solutions.\n*   RefAug's effectiveness extends to code generation tasks, indicating its broad applicability in improving reasoning skills.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel training technique for language models (LMs) designed to enhance mathematical reasoning beyond basic forward steps. Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the training set with more problems, RefAug enriches each training instance by appending a \"reflection\" section. This section includes alternative reasoning approaches and follow-up scenarios (abstraction or analogy), encouraging deeper understanding and flexible application of mathematical concepts. Experiments show RefAug significantly boosts performance on both standard single-round math problems and more complex reflective reasoning tasks, such as error correction and multi-turn question answering. RefAug also proves complementary to existing augmentation methods, yielding further gains when combined. The technique is also effective in code generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. An ablation study confirms the value of both alternative and follow-up reasoning components, and analysis indicates that RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors, leading to more robust mathematical capabilities.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by incorporating \"reflection\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data, promoting deeper understanding.\n*   RefAug significantly improves performance on both standard math QA and complex reflective reasoning tasks, outperforming traditional data augmentation methods in the latter.\n*   The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to synergistic performance gains.\n*   RefAug is effective in code generation tasks, indicating its generalizability beyond mathematical reasoning.\n*   Ablation studies show that both alternative and follow-up reasoning components are crucial for RefAug's success, and the technique primarily reduces reasoning errors.",

      "summary": "The article introduces \"Reflective Augmentation\" (RefAug), a novel training technique for language models (LMs) designed to enhance their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Unlike traditional data augmentation methods that simply expand the dataset with more problem-answer pairs, RefAug enriches each training instance by appending a \"reflective section\" to the original solution. This section comprises two components: \"alternative reasoning,\" which presents a different method to solve the problem, and \"follow-up reasoning,\" which generalizes the problem or applies its principles to a more complex scenario. This approach aims to foster a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and methodologies, moving beyond rote memorization. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug not only improves performance on standard single-round question-answering tasks but also significantly boosts capabilities in more complex reflective reasoning scenarios, such as error correction and multi-turn problem-solving. Furthermore, RefAug complements existing data augmentation techniques, leading to synergistic improvements. The method has also shown promise in code generation tasks, indicating its broader applicability.\n\n**KEY HIGHLIGHTS:**\n\n*   RefAug enhances LM mathematical reasoning by adding \"reflective sections\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) to training data, promoting deeper understanding beyond simple answer generation.\n*   The technique improves performance on both standard math problems and complex tasks requiring reflective capabilities like error correction.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation methods, leading to further performance gains when combined.\n*   The approach is effective across different base models and has shown promise in code generation tasks.\n*   RefAug trains models to engage with abstractions and analogies, enabling more flexible application of learned concepts.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel training technique designed to enhance mathematical reasoning in language models (LMs) by incorporating problem reflection into training data. Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the training set with more problems, RefAug enriches each existing training instance by appending a \"reflective section.\" This section includes alternative reasoning approaches and follow-up scenarios (abstraction or analogy), encouraging LMs to develop deeper understanding and more flexible problem-solving skills. RefAug demonstrably improves performance on standard single-round math reasoning tasks and significantly boosts capabilities in complex reflective reasoning scenarios like follow-up questions and error correction, where other augmentation methods fall short. The approach is also shown to be effective in code generation and is complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to synergistic performance gains.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by adding \"reflective sections\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) to training data, promoting deeper understanding beyond basic forward reasoning.\n*   The method significantly improves performance on complex reflective reasoning tasks (e.g., error correction, multi-turn QA) where traditional data expansion methods are less effective.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, leading to further performance gains when combined.\n*   The approach is effective in code generation and demonstrates scalability and minimal impact on inference efficiency.\n*   Ablation studies show that both alternative and follow-up reasoning components contribute to performance improvements, with their combination yielding the best results.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel training technique for language models (LMs) that enhances mathematical reasoning by incorporating \"reflection\" into each training instance. Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the training set with more problems, RefAug augments the sequence of existing problems by appending a \"reflective section\" to the original solution. This section includes alternative reasoning paths and follow-up reasoning (abstraction or analogy), encouraging LMs to deeply understand problem-solving methodologies and generalize them. Experiments show RefAug significantly boosts performance in both standard single-round math QA and complex reflective reasoning scenarios (like error correction and multi-turn problem-solving). It also complements existing data augmentation methods, leading to further gains. The study further explores RefAug's impact on code generation, its effectiveness with varying data amounts, the benefits of its components, and its stability, demonstrating its broad applicability and value in developing more robust mathematical reasoning in LMs.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LM mathematical reasoning by adding \"reflection\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) to training data, fostering deeper understanding beyond basic forward reasoning.\n*   The method significantly improves performance in both standard math QA and complex reflective reasoning tasks, outperforming traditional data expansion methods in the latter.\n*   RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing augmentation techniques, leading to synergistic performance gains.\n*   The approach is effective across different LM architectures and shows promise in code generation tasks, indicating a generalizable mechanism for improving reasoning.\n*   RefAug enhances reasoning by reducing reasoning errors more than calculation errors, suggesting it cultivates a deeper understanding of mathematical principles.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel training technique for language models (LMs) designed to enhance mathematical reasoning capabilities beyond basic forward steps. Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the training set with more problems, RefAug enriches each existing training instance by appending a \"reflective section.\" This section encourages the LM to consider alternative approaches to solving a problem and to explore follow-up reasoning, such as abstraction or analogy to more complex scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance in standard single-round math question-answering tasks, outperforming direct fine-tuning. Crucially, RefAug excels in more complex reflective reasoning tasks, such as error correction and multi-turn question answering, where traditional augmentation methods fall short. The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing techniques, leading to even greater performance gains when combined. Furthermore, RefAug proves effective in code generation tasks, highlighting its general applicability in improving structured reasoning. Ablation studies confirm that both alternative and follow-up reasoning components contribute to performance gains, and the scalability of RefAug is shown by its effectiveness with increasing amounts of augmented data.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LMs by embedding \"reflection\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data, moving beyond basic forward reasoning.\n*   RefAug significantly improves performance on both standard math QA and complex reflective reasoning tasks, complementing existing data augmentation methods.\n*   The method is effective in code generation, demonstrating its broader applicability to structured reasoning tasks.\n*   Ablation studies show that both alternative and follow-up reasoning components are crucial for RefAug's success, and its benefits scale with the proportion of augmented data.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel training technique for language models (LMs) designed to enhance mathematical reasoning skills beyond basic forward progression. Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the training set, RefAug enriches each training instance with a \"reflection\" section. This section includes alternative reasoning pathways and follow-up scenarios (abstraction or analogy), encouraging LMs to develop deeper comprehension through reflective thinking. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance in both standard single-round math question-answering and, crucially, in more complex reflective reasoning tasks like error correction and multi-turn problem-solving, where prior methods fall short. RefAug is also shown to be complementary to existing augmentation techniques, leading to even greater gains when combined. The study also explores the impact of RefAug on code generation, its stability, the amount of data needed, and its efficiency compared to other methods, concluding that it effectively cultivates more robust and flexible mathematical reasoning capabilities in LMs.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by incorporating \"reflection\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data.\n*   The method significantly improves performance on complex reflective reasoning tasks, outperforming traditional data expansion techniques.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation methods, leading to synergistic performance gains.\n*   The technique is effective across various models and tasks, including code generation, and does not negatively impact inference efficiency.\n*   Ablation studies confirm that both alternative and follow-up reasoning components contribute to performance improvements.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel training technique designed to enhance mathematical reasoning capabilities in language models (LMs) by incorporating problem reflection into training instances. Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the dataset size, RefAug targets the sequence dimension by appending a \"reflective section\" to existing problem solutions. This section includes alternative reasoning approaches and follow-up reasoning (abstraction or analogy), encouraging LMs to engage in deeper understanding and flexible application of mathematical concepts. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance not only in standard single-round question-answering but also in more complex reflective reasoning scenarios (like error correction and multi-turn problem-solving) where existing methods fall short.

      "summary": "The article \"Learn Beyond The Answer: Training Language Models with Reflection for Mathematical Reasoning\" introduces a novel training technique called reflective augmentation (RefAug) to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of language models (LMs). Unlike traditional data augmentation methods that expand the training set with more problems, RefAug embeds problem reflection directly into each training instance. This reflection involves providing alternative reasoning paths and follow-up scenarios (abstraction or analogy) alongside the original solution. The goal is to foster a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and methodologies, moving beyond mere pattern recognition. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance in both standard single-round question-answering tasks and more complex reflective reasoning scenarios, such as error correction and multi-turn problem-solving. Importantly, RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to further performance gains when combined. The study also shows RefAug's effectiveness in code generation, suggesting reflection is a crucial skill for LMs across various domains.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) is a new training method that integrates problem reflection (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into each training instance for LMs.\n*   RefAug enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by fostering a deeper understanding, improving performance in both standard and complex reflective tasks.\n*   The technique is complementary to existing data augmentation methods, yielding synergistic performance improvements.\n*   RefAug has also shown effectiveness in improving LMs' performance on code generation tasks.\n*   During inference, the model stops generation after the original answer, preserving efficiency.",
