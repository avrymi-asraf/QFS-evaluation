The authors introduce counterfactual pairs as a formal language to define linear representations in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces. They demonstrate that these definitions connect to \"measurement\" (linear probing) and \"intervention\" (model steering), respectively. A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which is designed such that causally separable concepts are represented orthogonally. This specific inner product is shown to unify the embedding and unembedding representations, providing a coherent geometric framework. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and show that the causal inner product respects semantic structure, enabling the construction of probes and steering vectors from counterfactual data. The work emphasizes that while the concept of linear representation is appealing, the choice of inner product is crucial for its meaningful application.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactual pairs are used as a formal language to define linear representations of concepts in LLMs, bridging disparate intuitions.\n*   The paper formalizes two notions of linear representation: \"unembedding representations\" linked to measurement and \"embedding representations\" linked to intervention.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which treats causally separable concepts as orthogonal, unifying embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate that this causal inner product captures semantic structure and allows for the construction of interpretable and controllable representations.\n*   The work highlights the critical role of the inner product choice in making geometric notions like similarity and projection semantically meaningful for LLM representations.",

The authors introduce counterfactuals as a formal language to define linear representations in both the input (context) and output (word) spaces of LLMs. They demonstrate that these distinct notions of linear representation—subspace, measurement (via probing), and intervention (via steering)—are connected. A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which respects the semantic independence of causally separable concepts. This inner product unifies the input and output linear representations, allowing for the construction of probes and steering vectors from counterfactual pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations, the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic structure, and the ability to use these representations for model interpretation and control.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactuals are used as a formal language to define and connect different notions of linear representations (subspace, measurement, intervention) within LLMs.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which captures semantic independence by making causally separable concepts orthogonal, unifying input and output representations.\n*   The paper establishes that unembedding representations are linked to measurement (probing) and embedding representations are linked to intervention (steering).\n*   The proposed causal inner product allows for the construction of both interpretation (probes) and control (steering) mechanisms using counterfactual data.\n*   Empirical results with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the presence of linear concept representations, the semantic relevance of the causal inner product, and its utility for model control.",

The authors leverage counterfactuals to define linear representations in two distinct spaces: the \"unembedding\" space (output word representations) and the \"embedding\" space (input context representations). Definition 2.1 formalizes unembedding representations as directions in the unembedding space derived from counterfactual word pairs. Definition 2.3 defines embedding representations in a similar manner for input contexts, requiring specific relationships with off-target concepts. Theorem 2.2 establishes a connection between unembedding representations and \"measurement,\" showing they act as linear probes for concepts. Theorem 2.5 links embedding representations to \"intervention,\" demonstrating how adding them to context representations alters concept probabilities without affecting causally separable concepts. Crucially, Definition 3.1 introduces the \"causal inner product,\" an inner product that treats causally separable concepts as orthogonal. Theorem 3.2 proves that this causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, transforming them into equivalent entities. Theorem 3.4 provides an explicit form for this causal inner product, linking it to the covariance of unembedding vectors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactual pairs are used to formally define linear representations in both output (unembedding) and input (embedding) spaces.\n*   Unembedding representations are linked to \"measurement\" (linear probing), while embedding representations are linked to \"intervention\" (concept steering).\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which treats causally separable concepts as orthogonal, unifying embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   The causal inner product can be explicitly formulated based on the covariance of unembedding vectors, providing a principled way to define geometric notions in representation space.",

It addresses the ambiguity of what \"linear representation\" means by offering two formalizations: one for output (word) representations and another for input (context) representations. Crucially, it employs counterfactual language to define these representations. The research demonstrates that the output-space formalization connects to \"measurement\" (e.g., linear probing), while the input-space formalization links to \"intervention\" (e.g., model steering). To reconcile geometric notions like similarity and projection, the paper introduces a \"causal inner product\" that respects the separability of concepts. This inner product unifies the input and output representations, allowing for the construction of probes and steering vectors using counterfactual pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these findings, showing the existence of linear concept representations, their link to interpretation and control, and the significant role of the chosen inner product.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes \"linear representation\" in language models using counterfactuals, distinguishing between output (unembedding) and input (embedding) spaces.\n*   Unembedding representations are shown to connect to \"measurement\" (e.g., linear probes), while embedding representations link to \"intervention\" (e.g., model steering).\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced to unify these disparate linear representations, based on the principle that causally separable concepts are orthogonal.\n*   This causal inner product enables the construction of both probes and steering vectors using counterfactual word pairs.\n*   Empirical results with LLaMA-2 confirm the existence of linear concept representations and their connection to model interpretation and control, highlighting the importance of the inner product choice.",

The authors introduce counterfactuals as a formal language to define these representations. Two primary formalizations are presented: \"unembedding representations\" in the output space, which connect to the \"measurement\" notion (e.g., linear probes), and \"embedding representations\" in the input space, linked to the \"intervention\" notion (e.g., model steering). A key contribution is the concept of a \"causal inner product,\" an inner product that treats causally separable concepts as orthogonal. This causal inner product is shown to unify the embedding and unembedding representations, transforming them into a single, coherent geometric structure. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these formalizations, demonstrating that concepts are indeed represented linearly, that the causal inner product respects semantic structure by achieving approximate orthogonality for separable concepts, and that these representations can be used for both interpretation (measurement) and control (intervention).\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactuals are used as a formal language to define linear representations of concepts in LLMs.\n*   Two distinct formalizations of linear representation are proposed: unembedding (linked to measurement) and embedding (linked to intervention).\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which makes causally separable concepts orthogonal and unifies embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   The causal inner product enables the construction of probes and steering vectors from counterfactual pairs, demonstrating its utility for interpretation and control.\n*   Experiments confirm the existence of linear representations and the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic structure and enabling intervention.",

SUMMARY:\n\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis\" by using counterfactuals as a formal language to describe how high-level concepts are represented linearly in language models. It addresses two key challenges: defining \"linear representation\" and making sense of geometric notions in representation spaces. The authors propose two formalizations of linear representation: one in the output (unembedding) space, which connects to measurement (linear probing), and another in the input (embedding) space, which connects to intervention (model steering). To handle geometric notions like similarity and projection, they introduce a \"causal inner product.\" This specific inner product is designed such that causally separable concepts are represented by orthogonal vectors. Crucially, this causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for the construction of probes and steering vectors using counterfactual pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of these linear representations, their link to interpretation and control, and highlight the significance of the chosen inner product.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n*   Counterfactual pairs are used to formally define linear representations in both unembedding (output) and embedding (input) spaces, connecting them to measurement and intervention respectively.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which ensures causally separable concepts are represented orthogonally, thereby unifying embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   Unembedding representations function as linear probes for concepts, and embedding representations, derived via the causal inner product, enable controlled intervention (model steering).\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear concept representations and the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic structure and enabling interpretation/control.",

The authors introduce counterfactual pairs of words to define linear representations in both the output (unembedding) space and the input (embedding) space. They demonstrate that unembedding representations correspond to \"measurement\" (i.e., predicting concepts via linear probes), while embedding representations relate to \"intervention\" (i.e., steering model behavior by adding vectors). A key contribution is the concept of a \"causal inner product,\" which is defined such that causally separable concepts are orthogonal. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for the construction of intervention vectors from unembedding representations. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these formalizations, showing that concepts are indeed represented linearly and that the causal inner product captures semantic structure by ensuring orthogonality between causally independent concepts. The work highlights the crucial role of the inner product in understanding and manipulating these representations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactual pairs of words are used to formally define linear representations in both unembedding (output) and embedding (input) spaces of language models.\n*   Unembedding representations are linked to measurement (linear probing), while embedding representations are linked to intervention (model steering).\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, defined by the orthogonality of representations for causally separable concepts, which unifies embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 confirm the existence of linear concept representations and demonstrate that the causal inner product respects semantic structure.\n*   The paper establishes that embedding representations, derived from unembedding representations via the causal inner product, can be used to effectively intervene and control model outputs.",

The authors introduce counterfactuals as a formal language to define linear representations in both the output (unembedding) space and the input (embedding) space. Definition 2.1 formalizes \"unembedding representations\" as directions in the unembedding space derived from counterfactual word pairs. Definition 2.3 defines \"embedding representations\" based on context embeddings that vary a concept while keeping causally separable concepts invariant. Theorem 2.2 connects unembedding representations to \"measurement\" (linear probing), showing they predict concept presence logit-linearly. Theorem 2.5 links embedding representations to \"intervention\" (model steering), demonstrating that adding these vectors changes the target concept's probability without affecting others. A key contribution is the concept of a \"causal inner product\" (Definition 3.1), which mandates orthogonality for causally separable concepts. Theorem 3.2 shows this inner product unifies embedding and unembedding representations, creating a \"unified representation space.\" This framework allows for the construction of probes and steering vectors using counterfactual pairs, with experiments on LLaMA-2 supporting the existence of these representations and the utility of the causal inner product.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactuals are used to formally define \"unembedding representations\" (Definition 2.1) and \"embedding representations\" (Definition 2.3) of concepts in language models.\n*   Unembedding representations are linked to \"measurement\" (linear probing) via Theorem 2.2, enabling prediction of concept presence.\n*   Embedding representations are linked to \"intervention\" (model steering) via Theorem 2.5, allowing controlled manipulation of concepts.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" (Definition 3.1) is introduced, requiring orthogonality for causally separable concepts, and it unifies embedding and unembedding representations (Theorem 3.2).\n*   The proposed framework demonstrates that counterfactual pairs can be used to construct both interpretation (probes) and control (steering vectors) mechanisms.",

They demonstrate that unembedding representations connect to measurement (e.g., linear probing) and embedding representations connect to intervention (e.g., model steering). A key contribution is the concept of a \"causal inner product,\" which is defined to be zero for causally separable concepts. This causal inner product is shown to unify the embedding and unembedding representations, providing a geometric framework for understanding LLM behavior. The paper derives an explicit form for this inner product and empirically validates their findings using LLaMA-2, showing that concept directions act as linear probes and that interventions based on these directions effectively control model output without affecting unrelated concepts. The work highlights the crucial role of the inner product in making sense of these linear representations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactual pairs provide a formal language to define linear representations in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces of LLMs.\n*   Unembedding representations are linked to measurement (probing), while embedding representations are linked to intervention (steering).\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which is zero for causally separable concepts, unifying embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   Concept directions, when represented within the framework of the causal inner product, act as linear probes for measuring concepts and enable targeted interventions to control model behavior.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 confirm the existence of linear representations for concepts and demonstrate the utility of the causal inner product in understanding and manipulating LLM outputs.",

The authors introduce counterfactuals as a formal language to define two types of linear representations: unembedding representations, which connect to measurement (probing), and embedding representations, which connect to intervention (steering). A key contribution is the definition of a \"causal inner product\" that respects the semantic independence of causally separable concepts. This inner product unifies the unembedding and embedding representations, allowing for a more coherent understanding of geometric notions like similarity and projection. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of these linear representations, validate the causal inner product's ability to capture semantic structure by showing orthogonality between causally separable concepts, and confirm the connection between these representations and model interpretation/control. The work highlights the crucial role of the inner product choice in making sense of these geometric properties.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactuals are used to formally define unembedding (measurement) and embedding (intervention) representations of concepts in language models.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is proposed, which formalizes the intuition that causally separable concepts should be represented orthogonally.\n*   This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, providing a consistent geometric framework.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 empirically validate the existence of linear representations and the causal inner product's ability to capture semantic structure and enable model interpretation and control.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" which posits that high-level concepts are represented linearly within language models. The authors introduce counterfactuals as a formal language to define two types of linear representations: unembedding representations, which connect to measurement (probing), and embedding representations, which connect to intervention (steering). A key contribution is the definition of a \"causal inner product\" that respects the semantic independence of causally separable concepts. This inner product unifies the unembedding and embedding representations, allowing for a more coherent understanding of geometric notions like similarity and projection. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of these linear representations, validate the causal inner product's ability to capture semantic structure by showing orthogonality between causally separable concepts, and confirm the connection between these representations and model interpretation/control. The work highlights the crucial role of the inner product choice in making sense of these geometric properties.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactuals are used to formally define unembedding (measurement) and embedding (intervention) representations of concepts in language models.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is proposed, which formalizes the intuition that causally separable concepts should be represented orthogonally.\n*   This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, providing a consistent geometric framework.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 empirically validate the existence of linear representations and the causal inner product's ability to capture semantic structure and enable model interpretation and control.",
