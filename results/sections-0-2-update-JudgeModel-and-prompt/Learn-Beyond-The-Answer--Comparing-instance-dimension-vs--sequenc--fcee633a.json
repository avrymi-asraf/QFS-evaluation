      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nEnhancing LLM reasoning through data augmentation involves two primary dimensions: instance-dimension and sequence-dimension. Instance-dimension augmentation focuses on varying the *input problem statement* itself. This includes techniques like paraphrasing questions, altering numerical values, or rephrasing premises, all while preserving the core logical challenge. Its main objective is to improve an LLM's robustness to surface-level variations, ensuring the model can identify and solve the underlying reasoning task irrespective of its specific presentation. This approach broadens the diversity of individual training examples, making the model less sensitive to exact wording or formatting.\n\nConversely, sequence-dimension augmentation targets the *reasoning process* or *chain of thought*. This involves generating alternative valid reasoning steps, varying the order of logical arguments, or introducing diverse intermediate explanations that lead to a correct conclusion. Its aim is to teach the LLM multiple pathways to solve a problem, fostering more flexible and deeper reasoning capabilities. While instance augmentation expands the *problem space* an LLM encounters, sequence augmentation enriches the *solution space* and the model's internal navigation of it. Both are crucial: instance augmentation ensures the model grasps the problem in various forms, while sequence augmentation builds a more sophisticated and adaptable internal reasoning mechanism, with combined approaches often yielding the most significant performance gains.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   **Instance-dimension augmentation** diversifies the *input problem statement* (e.g., paraphrasing, rephrasing) to boost robustness against superficial changes and expand problem recognition.\n*   **Sequence-dimension augmentation** modifies the *reasoning process* or *chain of thought* (e.g., alternative steps, varied argument order) to cultivate flexible and deeper reasoning paths.\n*   Instance augmentation primarily improves an LLM's ability to *recognize* the underlying task despite input variations.\n*   Sequence augmentation primarily enhances an LLM's capacity to *construct and navigate* diverse logical solution pathways.\n*   A combined approach leveraging both instance and sequence augmentation often achieves superior improvements in overall LLM reasoning performance.",
