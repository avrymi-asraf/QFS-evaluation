      "summary": "1.  **SUMMARY:**\n    The lifecycle and cross-type transformation of memory are governed by multifaceted mechanisms spanning molecular, cellular, and systems levels. At the core of memory consolidation are molecular and cellular processes, involving synaptic plasticity like long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), which are initiated by neural activity and solidified through gene expression, protein synthesis, and structural modifications at synaptic connections. Declarative memories, encompassing both episodic and semantic forms, undergo systems consolidation, where their initial dependence on the hippocampus gradually diminishes. This \"hippocampus-to-cortex shift\" transfers stable memory traces to widespread neocortical networks, a process often facilitated by sleep-dependent memory replay. This systems-level reorganization is crucial for the transformation of vivid episodic memories, rich in contextual detail, into generalized, decontextualized semantic knowledge. Furthermore, once formed, memories are not static; upon retrieval, they can become transiently labile, necessitating reconsolidation to maintain their stability, a process distinct from extinction, which involves new learning that suppresses rather than erases the original memory. The lifecycle of non-declarative memories, such as procedural skills, often involves different neural substrates like the basal ganglia and cerebellum, exhibiting a more gradual and less flexible acquisition. Intriguingly, declarative knowledge can, through extensive practice, convert into automatic, procedural memory, highlighting a dynamic interconversion between memory types.\n\n2.  **KEY HIGHLIGHTS:**\n    *   Molecular and cellular consolidation involves synaptic plasticity (LTP/LTD), gene expression, protein synthesis, and structural changes at synapses.\n    *   Systems consolidation facilitates the hippocampus-to-cortex shift of declarative memories, crucial for long-term storage and the transformation of episodic into semantic memory.\n    *   Memory retrieval can trigger reconsolidation (restabilization) or extinction (inhibition by new learning), distinct processes influencing memory fate.\n    *   Declarative and non-declarative memories follow different lifecycles, involving distinct neural substrates and acquisition characteristics.\n    *   Declarative knowledge can convert into procedural memory through repetitive practice, demonstrating a cross-type transformation.",

  "final_summary": "1.  **SUMMARY:**\n    The lifecycle and cross-type transformation of memory are governed by multifaceted mechanisms spanning molecular, cellular, and systems levels. At the core of memory consolidation are molecular and cellular processes, involving synaptic plasticity like long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), which are initiated by neural activity and solidified through gene expression, protein synthesis, and structural modifications at synaptic connections. Declarative memories, encompassing both episodic and semantic forms, undergo systems consolidation, where their initial dependence on the hippocampus gradually diminishes. This \"hippocampus-to-cortex shift\" transfers stable memory traces to widespread neocortical networks, a process often facilitated by sleep-dependent memory replay. This systems-level reorganization is crucial for the transformation of vivid episodic memories, rich in contextual detail, into generalized, decontextualized semantic knowledge. Furthermore, once formed, memories are not static; upon retrieval, they can become transiently labile, necessitating reconsolidation to maintain their stability, a process distinct from extinction, which involves new learning that suppresses rather than erases the original memory. The lifecycle of non-declarative memories, such as procedural skills, often involves different neural substrates like the basal ganglia and cerebellum, exhibiting a more gradual and less flexible acquisition. Intriguingly, declarative knowledge can, through extensive practice, convert into automatic, procedural memory, highlighting a dynamic interconversion between memory types.\n\n2.  **KEY HIGHLIGHTS:**\n    *   Molecular and cellular consolidation involves synaptic plasticity (LTP/LTD), gene expression, protein synthesis, and structural changes at synapses.\n    *   Systems consolidation facilitates the hippocampus-to-cortex shift of declarative memories, crucial for long-term storage and the transformation of episodic into semantic memory.\n    *   Memory retrieval can trigger reconsolidation (restabilization) or extinction (inhibition by new learning), distinct processes influencing memory fate.\n    *   Declarative and non-declarative memories follow different lifecycles, involving distinct neural substrates and acquisition characteristics.\n    *   Declarative knowledge can convert into procedural memory through repetitive practice, demonstrating a cross-type transformation.",
