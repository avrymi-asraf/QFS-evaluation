SUMMARY:\nA novel geometric framework, termed the Unified Semantic Directional Geometry (USDG), formally connects the subspace hypothesis with linear probing and activation steering. This framework posits that latent semantic properties, exemplified by Word2Vec analogies (e.g., `king - man + woman = queen`), are encoded as specific, interpretable directions or subspaces within a model's high-dimensional activation space. Linear probing techniques are then understood as methods to *discover* these semantic directions by identifying hyperplanes or projection axes that maximally separate or reveal specific attributes. Conversely, activation steering is framed as the deliberate *manipulation* of a model's internal state by traversing these very same semantic directions, thereby guiding its behavior or output in a controlled manner. The USDG framework clarifies that linear probing serves as an analytical tool to map the model's internal semantic geometry, while activation steering acts as an interventional tool leveraging this geometry. This unified perspective addresses previous limitations of the subspace hypothesis by providing a more rigorous geometric foundation for its observed effectiveness and enhances model interpretability by grounding practical interventions in a coherent theoretical space.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The Unified Semantic Directional Geometry (USDG) framework connects the subspace hypothesis, linear probing, and activation steering within a single geometric space.\n*   Semantic properties, as seen in Word2Vec analogies, are represented as specific directions in the model's activation space.\n*   Linear probing functions as a discovery mechanism, identifying these semantic directions through hyperplane detection or projection.\n*   Activation steering is an application mechanism, directly manipulating model activations along these discovered semantic directions to control behavior.\n*   This framework enhances model interpretability by providing a formal geometric basis for both the discovery and intervention of latent semantic features.",
