It advocates for deriving these geometries from the comprehensive statistical properties inherent in a model's *full vocabulary*, rather than exclusively relying on the distributional patterns observed within its specific training data. The core premise is that focusing on the global lexicon can yield more robust and universally applicable semantic spaces, mitigating the biases and limitations often introduced by corpus-specific idiosyncrasies or data sparsity. By analyzing the broader statistical landscape of all known words, the methodology aims to uncover deeper, more intrinsic semantic relationships, potentially leveraging graph-based structures, lexical networks, or other meta-statistics across the entire vocabulary. This paradigm shift promises to generate more stable, generalized, and semantically coherent embeddings, ultimately enhancing performance in tasks requiring nuanced linguistic understanding and knowledge representation, independent of the particular training corpus used. Such a derivation moves beyond mere local co-occurrence counts, seeking to capture the inherent structural organization of language itself. This approach could lead to embedding spaces less prone to catastrophic forgetting or domain shift issues, offering a more foundational and enduring semantic foundation for AI systems and improving their ability to generalize across diverse linguistic contexts.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Proposes deriving semantic geometry from global vocabulary statistics, not just training data distribution.\n*   Aims for more robust, universally applicable semantic representations by mitigating corpus biases.\n*   Leverages broader statistical properties and intrinsic lexical structures across the entire vocabulary.\n*   Seeks to create stable, generalized, and intrinsically meaningful semantic spaces.\n*   Offers a pathway to improved linguistic understanding and knowledge representation, less reliant on specific training data.",
