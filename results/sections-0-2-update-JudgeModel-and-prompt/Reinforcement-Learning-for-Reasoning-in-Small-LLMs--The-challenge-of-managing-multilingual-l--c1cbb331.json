Therefore, a summary addressing the challenge of managing multilingual language drift when fine-tuning a foundational model for a monolingual reasoning task cannot be generated. To create this summary, an article discussing specific methodologies, observed issues, and potential solutions related to cross-lingual interference, catastrophic forgetting in fine-tuning, and strategies for maintaining monolingual task performance while mitigating multilingual biases would be required. Such an article would typically delve into how a model's inherent multilingual capabilities, while beneficial for general understanding, can introduce noise or misdirection when the target task demands strict monolingual adherence, especially concerning subtle semantic nuances or domain-specific reasoning patterns. Without the source text, any attempt to summarize would be speculative and not reflective of actual content.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   No source article was provided for summarization.\n*   A summary on multilingual language drift in fine-tuning for monolingual tasks requires specific textual content.\n*   Key aspects of such an article would likely include cross-lingual interference, catastrophic forgetting, and bias mitigation strategies.\n*   Without an article, specific facts, findings, or methods cannot be extracted or highlighted.",
