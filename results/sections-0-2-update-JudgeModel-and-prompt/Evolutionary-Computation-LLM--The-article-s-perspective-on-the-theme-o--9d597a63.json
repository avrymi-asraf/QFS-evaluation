SUMMARY:\nTo provide a cohesive overview of the article's perspective on the theme of black-box optimization, as per the user's query, the content of the article itself is indispensable. Unfortunately, no article text was provided for analysis in this iteration. Consequently, it is impossible to identify and articulate the specific viewpoints, methodologies, case studies, or theoretical discussions that the article might present concerning black-box optimization. Without access to the source material, any attempt to summarize or extract key insights would be speculative and not reflective of a given text. A comprehensive summary, detailing the article's stance on the challenges, advantages, common algorithms, or emerging trends within black-box optimization, cannot be accurately generated. To fulfill the request for a 200-250 word summary and subsequent key highlights, please provide the complete article content for review and extraction of relevant information. The summarization process relies entirely on the input text to accurately capture its unique contribution to the understanding of black-box optimization.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n- Article content was not provided for summarization.\n- Impossible to determine the article's perspective on black-box optimization without source text.\n- A summary and key highlights cannot be generated from a blank input.\n- Please provide the article to enable the requested analysis.",
