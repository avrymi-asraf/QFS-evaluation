      "summary": "SUMMARY:\nFine-tuning language models for mathematical tasks fundamentally relies on the intricate interplay between the quantity, quality, and complexity of the training data. While a large volume of data (quantity) can provide models with extensive exposure to various problem types and solution methodologies, its utility is significantly constrained if the data itself is flawed. Data quality is arguably the most critical factor in mathematical domains; absolute accuracy, logical consistency, and correct step-by-step reasoning are non-negotiable. Even subtle errors in examples can lead to catastrophic failures in the model's mathematical inference, propagating incorrect understanding and undermining reliability. Concurrently, the complexity of the mathematical problems presented is crucial. Datasets primarily focused on basic arithmetic may not equip a model for advanced topics like calculus or abstract algebra, demanding the inclusion of progressively challenging and diverse problem structures that reflect the target task's difficulty. The most effective strategies emphasize a symbiotic balance: sufficient data quantity to enable pattern recognition, coupled with uncompromising quality to ensure mathematical rigor, and carefully calibrated complexity to foster robust and generalizable reasoning abilities. Neglecting any of these dimensions in isolation can severely impede a model's capacity to perform sophisticated mathematical operations or solve novel problems, highlighting the necessity of a holistic data engineering approach.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n1.  **Quality is Paramount:** For mathematical tasks, data quality (accuracy, logical consistency, correctness) is the most critical factor, as even minor errors severely degrade model performance and reliability.\n2.  **Strategic Complexity:** Fine-tuning datasets must include progressively complex and diverse mathematical problems to enable models to generalize effectively beyond foundational operations.\n3.  **Balanced Interplay:** Optimal fine-tuning requires a strategic balance of sufficient data quantity for breadth, exceptionally high quality for correctness, and appropriate complexity for deep, robust mathematical reasoning.\n4.  **Interdependence:** Quantity, quality, and complexity are interdependent; deficiencies in one area cannot be fully offset by strengths in others, especially when tackling advanced mathematical challenges.",
