To fulfill the user's query, I require the source text containing the relevant economic data and analysis for both model scales. Without the article, I cannot extract specific findings regarding development costs, training efficiency, inference costs, or the trade-offs between model size and reasoning capabilities from an economic perspective. The requested 200-250 word overview necessitates a foundational document detailing the financial investments and operational expenses associated with reaching peak performance in differing model architectures.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n1.  The source article required for the economic analysis of LLM vs. SLM reasoning performance was not provided.\n2.  Without the specified text, no specific economic data or comparative findings can be extracted.\n3.  An analysis of cost-efficiency, resource allocation, and performance-per-dollar for different model sizes cannot be generated.\n4.  The request for specific economic trade-offs in achieving state-of-the-art reasoning remains unaddressed due to the absence of input material.",
