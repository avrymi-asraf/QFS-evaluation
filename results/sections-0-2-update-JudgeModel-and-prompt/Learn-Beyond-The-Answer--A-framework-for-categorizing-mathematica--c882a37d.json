SUMMARY:\nThis framework proposes a hierarchical categorization for evaluating mathematical reasoning skills in language models (LMs), spanning from foundational forward reasoning to advanced reflective capabilities. It outlines five distinct levels, each building upon the preceding one. Level 1, \"Basic Computation & Rule Application,\" encompasses straightforward arithmetic, symbolic manipulation, and adherence to explicit mathematical rules, representing the most fundamental forward reasoning. Level 2, \"Multi-step Problem Solving,\" addresses the ability to decompose complex problems into sequential steps and execute a series of operations to reach a solution.\n\nAdvancing further, Level 3, \"Conceptual Understanding & Abstract Reasoning,\" focuses on an LM's capacity to grasp underlying mathematical concepts, identify patterns, make generalizations, and apply abstract principles beyond rote memorization. Level 4, \"Proof Generation & Validation,\" assesses the model's proficiency in constructing logical arguments, generating formal proofs, and critically validating the correctness of existing mathematical derivations. The pinnacle, Level 5, \"Reflective & Meta-Reasoning,\" evaluates an LM's ability to introspect on its own solution processes, identify and correct errors, explore alternative strategies, and understand the limitations or implications of its mathematical approaches, signifying true complex reflective capabilities. This structured framework offers a comprehensive lens for assessing and fostering robust mathematical intelligence in LMs.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The framework categorizes LM mathematical reasoning into five hierarchical levels, from basic to complex.\n*   It begins with \"Basic Computation & Rule Application\" (forward reasoning) and progresses through \"Multi-step Problem Solving.\"\n*   Intermediate levels include \"Conceptual Understanding & Abstract Reasoning\" and \"Proof Generation & Validation.\"\n*   The highest level, \"Reflective & Meta-Reasoning,\" covers self-correction, strategy adaptation, and understanding limitations.\n*   This categorization provides a systematic approach to evaluating and enhancing mathematical intelligence in LMs.",
