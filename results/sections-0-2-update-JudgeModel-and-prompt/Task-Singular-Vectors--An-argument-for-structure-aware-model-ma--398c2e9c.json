SUMMARY:\nI am unable to provide a summary or key highlights arguing for structure-aware model manipulation over flattened parameter approaches, as the article content was explicitly provided as 'None'. To fulfill your request effectively and adhere to the specified word count and content focus, the full text of the relevant article is indispensable. Without the source material, it is impossible to extract specific arguments, evidence, or comparative analyses that would support the advantages of understanding and leveraging a model's inherent architectural structure – such as its layers, modules, or computational graphs – for tasks like fine-tuning, pruning, or targeted interventions. An article addressing your query would typically detail how structure-aware methods can lead to more efficient, interpretable, or effective model modifications by respecting the model's design principles, in contrast to treating a model as a simple, undifferentiated vector of parameters. It would likely present cases where structural insights enable more precise adjustments, better generalization, or overcome limitations of global, flattened parameter updates. Once the article is supplied, I can then analyze its content to specifically address how it discusses the benefits of exploiting structural knowledge for improved performance, reduced computational cost, or enhanced interpretability in model manipulation, directly addressing your query's perspective.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The article content was provided as 'None', preventing summarization.\n*   Specific arguments for structure-aware model manipulation cannot be extracted without source text.\n*   Evidence or examples relevant to the user's query are unavailable due to missing content.\n*   The full article text is required to generate the requested summary and highlights.",
