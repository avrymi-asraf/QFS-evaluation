To address the user's query effectively, an article detailing methodologies, experimental setups, and results concerning self-distillation's application in aligning different data modalities after their initial processing would be required. Without this foundational text, a cohesive overview of the topic from the perspective of its utility in post-hoc alignment cannot be generated. The user's specific interest in self-distillation as a *post-hoc* mechanism suggests a focus on aligning already-trained or pre-processed modal representations, rather than joint training. An article would typically elaborate on how a model trained on one modality (the teacher) could distill its knowledge to another model processing a different modality (the student) to bring their latent spaces into alignment *after* their initial independent processing, thereby achieving post-hoc alignment.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   No article content was provided for summarization.\n*   The user's query specifically focused on self-distillation as a *post-hoc* mechanism for modality alignment.\n*   Without an article, details on the application, benefits, or challenges of self-distillation in this context cannot be extracted.",
