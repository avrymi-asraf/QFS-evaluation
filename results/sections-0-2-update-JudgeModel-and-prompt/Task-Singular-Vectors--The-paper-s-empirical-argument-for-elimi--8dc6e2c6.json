To fulfill this request, please provide the full text of the article. Without the source material, I cannot extract information on experimental evidence, model stability, limitations, counterarguments, practical implications, proposed methods, or computational efficiency relevant to the user's query.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n1. Article content is missing, preventing summarization.\n2. Cannot extract empirical arguments for hyperparameter elimination without the source paper.\n3. Specific topics like experimental evidence and practical implications cannot be addressed without the provided text.",
