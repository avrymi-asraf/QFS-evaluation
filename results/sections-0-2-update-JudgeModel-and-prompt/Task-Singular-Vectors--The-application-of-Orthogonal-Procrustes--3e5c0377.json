      "summary": "1.  **SUMMARY:**\n    Orthogonal Procrustes Analysis (OPA) offers a robust methodology for decorrelating task-specific feature bases by identifying an optimal orthogonal transformation, primarily a rotation and/or reflection. In scenarios where feature representations derived from distinct tasks or learning processes exhibit undesirable correlations, OPA can be strategically employed to align one feature basis with another, or with a predefined orthogonal reference. The core of the technique involves minimizing the Frobenius norm of the difference between the transformed source feature basis and a target basis. This process yields an optimal orthogonal matrix that best superimposes the source onto the target, effectively reorienting the source's feature space. By applying this derived rotation, the features within the source basis can be significantly decorrelated, both internally and with respect to the target basis. This decorrelation is crucial for creating more distinct, less redundant, and interpretable feature sets, which in turn can mitigate issues like multicollinearity, improve the robustness and efficiency of subsequent machine learning models, and enhance the potential for effective knowledge transfer between tasks. The mathematical solution for OPA typically relies on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to precisely compute this distance-preserving, optimal rotation matrix, ensuring that the achieved decorrelation is geometrically sound and principled.\n\n2.  **KEY HIGHLIGHTS:**\n    *   OPA determines an optimal orthogonal transformation (rotation/reflection) to align one feature basis with another or a target.\n    *   It is applied to reduce unwanted correlations within or between task-specific feature bases.\n    *   The process minimizes the Frobenius norm of the difference between the transformed source and target bases.\n    *   Decorrelation yields more independent, interpretable, and robust feature representations, benefiting model performance and transfer learning.\n    *   The optimal rotation matrix is typically computed using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).",
