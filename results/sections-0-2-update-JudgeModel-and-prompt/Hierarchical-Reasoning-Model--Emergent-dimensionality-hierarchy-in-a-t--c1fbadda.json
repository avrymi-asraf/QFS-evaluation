SUMMARY:\nThis summary outlines an investigation into the spontaneous emergence of a dimensionality hierarchy within a trained artificial reasoning model, drawing a compelling parallel to the functional organization observed in the mouse cortex. The core finding reveals that as the reasoning model learns complex tasks, its internal representations self-organize into a structured hierarchy. Early layers of the model process and represent information in lower-dimensional spaces, corresponding to basic, atomic features of the input. Progressively, deeper layers integrate these simpler representations into higher-dimensional, more abstract, and integrated concepts necessary for complex reasoning. This emergent computational architecture strikingly mirrors the known functional organization of the mammalian cortex, particularly the mouse, where sensory areas handle foundational processing and associative regions integrate information into increasingly complex, abstract representations. The article posits that this parallel is not coincidental but indicative of shared computational principles. It suggests that the demands of efficient learning and robust reasoning, whether in biological or artificial systems, may inherently favor the development of such hierarchical, dimensionality-varying representational structures. This provides a novel computational lens through which to understand the brain's functional specialization and offers insights into the universal strategies underlying intelligent behavior.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A trained artificial reasoning model spontaneously develops an emergent dimensionality hierarchy in its internal representations.\n*   This hierarchy progresses from lower-dimensional, basic feature encoding in early layers to higher-dimensional, abstract concept integration in deeper layers.\n*   The emergent organizational structure draws a direct parallel to the functional organization of the mouse cortex, from sensory to associative areas.\n*   The research suggests that efficient learning and reasoning processes may inherently lead to similar hierarchical computational architectures in both artificial and biological intelligence.\n*   This parallel offers insights into the computational principles underlying cortical functional specialization and the universal strategies of intelligent systems.",
