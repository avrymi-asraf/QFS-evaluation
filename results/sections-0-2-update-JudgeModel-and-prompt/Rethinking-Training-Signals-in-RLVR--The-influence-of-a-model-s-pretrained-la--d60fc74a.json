      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThe influence of a model's pretrained latent abilities, such as code reasoning, profoundly shapes reinforcement learning outcomes, often significantly mitigating the impact of suboptimal reward signals. These latent capabilities, acquired during extensive pre-training on vast, diverse datasets, act as a powerful inductive bias, endowing the agent with a foundational understanding of structure, logic, and potential action consequences. For instance, an agent pre-trained on code can leverage this inherent reasoning to interpret complex state representations, infer underlying task mechanics, or even predict the long-term effects of actions, even when explicit rewards are sparse, noisy, or misspecified. This allows the agent to explore more intelligently, prioritize semantically meaningful actions, and construct more robust policies with fewer samples. Essentially, the model's internal \"world model\" or \"reasoning engine,\" derived from pre-training, can generate more informative internal signals or sub-goals, effectively compensating for external reward deficiencies. This reduces reliance on meticulous reward engineering, accelerating learning and improving overall performance in challenging environments where high-quality reward signals are difficult to design. The pretrained knowledge guides the agent toward more coherent and efficient behaviors, even when direct external feedback is ambiguous, leading to more stable and efficient learning trajectories and often superior final performance compared to tabula rasa agents.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Pretrained latent abilities (e.g., code reasoning) provide a strong inductive bias, enabling more efficient exploration and policy learning in RL.\n*   These abilities significantly compensate for sparse, noisy, or misspecified reward signals by allowing the agent to infer task logic and generate internal goals.\n*   They reduce sample complexity and improve generalization by leveraging prior knowledge to interpret states and predict action outcomes effectively.\n*   Pretrained reasoning helps filter out irrelevant reward noise, leading to more stable and robust learning trajectories even with imperfect feedback.\n*   This paradigm shifts the burden from meticulous reward engineering to pre-training, facilitating RL in complex environments with ambiguous or low-quality reward signals.",
