      "summary": "SUMMARY:\nAs no article was provided, it is impossible to generate a summary detailing the application of hierarchical processing, temporal separation, and local credit assignment from neuroscience to engineer stable, deep reasoning in artificial neural networks. To fulfill the user's specific query, an article would ideally be analyzed for its proposed methodologies, experimental validations, or theoretical frameworks that bridge these neuroscientific concepts with practical ANN engineering. Specifically, I would look for discussions on how hierarchical processing, characterized by multi-scale feature extraction and abstraction, contributes to robust, compositional reasoning, enabling ANNs to move beyond superficial pattern matching to deeper understanding. The text would also be examined for insights into temporal separation mechanisms, such as distinct learning phases or memory replay strategies, which are critical for disentangling sequential dependencies, mitigating interference, and fostering learning stability over extended periods. Furthermore, the summary would highlight novel approaches to local credit assignment, exploring how distributed and biologically plausible error propagation can enhance the efficiency and stability of learning, fostering more robust deep reasoning capabilities than global, undifferentiated feedback. The core focus would be on how the synergistic integration of these three principles directly addresses challenges in ANN stability, such as catastrophic forgetting or gradient instability, and facilitates the emergence of truly deep, systematic reasoning, enabling complex problem-solving. Without the article, specific findings or proposals remain unidentifiable.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n1. No article was provided, precluding the extraction of specific information regarding the user's query.\n2. An ideal article would detail architectural implementations of hierarchical processing for compositional and deep reasoning in ANNs.\n3. It would explore mechanisms for temporal separation to ensure learning stability and disentangle sequential dependencies.\n4. The article would discuss novel local credit assignment methods for robust and efficient deep learning within ANNs.\n5. The synthesis of these neuroscience principles would be shown to enhance ANN stability and facilitate deep, systematic reasoning capabilities.",
