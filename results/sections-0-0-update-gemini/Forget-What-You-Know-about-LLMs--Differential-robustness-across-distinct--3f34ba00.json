It delves into how different underlying architectures, such as Transformer variants (e.g., encoder-decoder, decoder-only) and potentially other emerging designs, exhibit varying degrees of resilience when faced with adversarial attacks, noisy inputs, or out-of-distribution data. The analysis likely examines how architectural choices, including attention mechanisms, layer normalization strategies, and embedding techniques, contribute to or detract from an LLM's ability to maintain consistent performance under challenging conditions. The objective is to identify which architectural families are inherently more robust, or conversely, more susceptible to specific types of perturbations. Understanding these differences is crucial for selecting appropriate LLMs for sensitive applications where reliability and predictability are paramount, and for guiding future research in developing more robust and trustworthy AI systems.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   LLM architectural families demonstrate varying levels of robustness against adversarial attacks and noisy inputs.\n*   Specific architectural components, such as attention mechanisms and normalization layers, influence an LLM's resilience.\n*   Decoder-only and encoder-decoder architectures may exhibit differential susceptibility to certain types of input perturbations.\n*   Identifying robust architectural families is critical for deploying LLMs in high-stakes applications.",
