SUMMARY:\nThe user's query centers on the observation that different model families (Qwen, Llama, OLMo) exhibit divergent behaviors even when subjected to identical Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) or Reinforcement Learning from Voice Preference (RLVP) training methodologies. This discrepancy suggests a significant limitation in the generalizability of current RLHF/RLVP techniques. Instead of applying uniformly, these methods appear to interact with the underlying architectural or pre-training characteristics of each model family in distinct ways, leading to varied outcomes in preference alignment or desired behavior. The core issue highlighted is a fundamental lack of technique generalization, implying that RLHF/RLVP are not universally applicable solutions but rather methods that require substantial adaptation or may even be inherently incompatible with certain model architectures or training paradigms. This divergence underscores a critical gap in our understanding of how these reward-based learning mechanisms interact with diverse large language model families, necessitating further research into model-specific adjustments or the development of more robust, generalizable alignment strategies.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Different model families (Qwen, Llama, OLMo) show varied responses to identical RLHF/RLVP training.\n*   This divergence indicates a fundamental lack of generalizability in current RLHF/RLVP techniques.\n*   The effectiveness of RLHF/RLVP is not uniform across all model architectures.\n*   Underlying model characteristics significantly influence the outcomes of preference alignment training.",
