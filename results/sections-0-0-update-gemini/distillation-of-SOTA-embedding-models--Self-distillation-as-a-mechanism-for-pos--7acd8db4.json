This technique leverages the internal knowledge of a pre-trained, potentially unimodal, model to guide the learning and integration of a new modality. Essentially, the \"teacher\" model (the original, well-trained model) generates soft targets or intermediate representations that act as a supervisory signal for a \"student\" model or a new component being trained on the additional modality. This process facilitates the alignment by encouraging the student to mimic the teacher's output distribution or feature space, thereby bridging the gap between modalities without requiring extensive, jointly annotated datasets. Self-distillation offers a flexible approach to modality fusion, enabling existing models to adapt to new data types or improve cross-modal understanding in a cost-effective manner. It’s particularly valuable when direct supervision for cross-modal tasks is scarce, allowing for a more robust and generalized representation that benefits from the strengths of each modality.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Self-distillation uses a pre-trained model (teacher) to guide the learning of a new modality (student).\n*   It enables post-hoc modality alignment without requiring large, jointly annotated datasets.\n*   The technique involves the teacher model generating soft targets or intermediate representations for the student.\n*   This process helps bridge the gap between modalities by encouraging the student to mimic the teacher's behavior.\n*   Self-distillation is a flexible and cost-effective method for cross-modal integration and knowledge transfer.",
