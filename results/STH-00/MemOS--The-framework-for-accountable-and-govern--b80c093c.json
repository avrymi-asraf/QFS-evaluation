It addresses the current LLM deficiency in unified and structured memory handling, which limits long-term knowledge evolution, adaptability, and cross-platform coordination. MemOS establishes a memory-centric execution framework by providing unified mechanisms for representation, organization, and governance across three core memory types: parametric (knowledge in weights), activation (runtime states like KV-caches), and plaintext (external retrieved data). The core innovation is the \"MemCube,\" a standardized memory abstraction that allows for tracking, fusion, and migration of heterogeneous memory, with structured and traceable access. This framework aims to enable LLMs to remember, adapt, and grow over time, facilitating continual adaptation, personalized intelligence, and multi-agent workflows by treating memory as a schedulable and evolvable resource with robust governance.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   MemOS treats memory as a first-class, schedulable, and governable resource for LLMs, moving beyond current ad-hoc memory management.\n*   It unifies and manages three core memory types: parametric, activation, and plaintext, through a standardized \"MemCube\" abstraction.\n*   The MemCube facilitates tracking, fusion, and migration of heterogeneous memory, enabling structured and traceable access across tasks and contexts.\n*   MemOS provides a memory-centric execution framework promoting controllability, adaptability, and evolvability in LLMs.\n*   This system aims to overcome limitations in long-term knowledge evolution, personalization, and multi-agent coordination for next-generation intelligent systems.",

SUMMARY:\nMemOS, a novel operating system for Large Language Models (LLMs), addresses the critical lack of structured memory management by treating memory as a first-class resource. It unifies parametric, activation, and plaintext memory types through a standardized abstraction called the Memory Cube (MemCube). The system's execution flow involves the MemScheduler selecting relevant memory based on context and policies, while the MemOperator organizes it semantically and structurally. The Infrastructure Layer, featuring MemGovernance and MemVault, ensures accountable and governed memory operations. MemGovernance specifically handles access permissions and audit trails, crucial for multi-user environments. Behavioral indicators within the MemCube metadata facilitate memory transformation between types, such as converting frequently accessed plaintext to activation states for efficiency.
