      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nMemOS, a novel memory operating system for Large Language Models (LLMs), addresses the lack of unified and structured memory handling in current LLMs by treating memory as a first-class operational resource. It establishes mechanisms for the lifecycle and cross-type transformation of three core memory types: parametric (encoded in weights), activation (transient inference states), and plaintext (external knowledge). The core of MemOS is the MemCube, a standardized abstraction that enables tracking, fusion, and migration of heterogeneous memory. Behavioral indicators within MemCube facilitate dynamic transformation pathways, such as converting frequently accessed plaintext into activation states for efficiency, or distilling stable knowledge from activation/plaintext into parametric modules. Conversely, outdated parametric memory can be externalized to plaintext for flexibility. This cross-type transformation, managed through a lifecycle framework and governed by access controls, allows LLMs to evolve, adapt to new knowledge, and maintain consistency across tasks and platforms, moving towards continually evolving intelligent agents.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   MemOS introduces unified mechanisms for the lifecycle and cross-type transformation of parametric, activation, and plaintext memory in LLMs.\n*   The MemCube abstraction standardizes heterogeneous memory, enabling tracking, fusion, and migration, with behavioral indicators driving transformation.\n*   Transformation pathways include Activation → Plaintext, Plaintext → Parametric, and Parametric → Plaintext, facilitating memory evolution and efficiency.\n*   MemOS aims to evolve LLMs from static generators to adaptive, continually learning agents by managing memory as a first-class resource.\n*   This memory-centric approach supports long-term knowledge evolution, personalization, and cross-platform coordination.",
