SUMMARY:\nRandom teacher distillation, where a student network learns from a teacher network at random initialization, pre-conditions the student for supervised training by inducing implicit regularization. This process, stripped of \"dark knowledge\" from a trained teacher and data augmentations, still leads to significant improvements in the student's representation quality, as measured by linear probing accuracy. Surprisingly, the student not only surpasses its random teacher but also develops characteristics similar to early-stage supervised training. Specifically, these students contain sparse subnetworks (\"lottery tickets\") and occupy positions on the border of linear basins within the supervised loss landscape. This suggests that label-independent optimization dynamics can effectively explore the supervised loss landscape. The research also highlights that initializing the student closely to the teacher amplifies this implicit regularization, leading to better feature learning.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Random teacher distillation induces implicit regularization, improving student representations even without \"dark knowledge\" or data augmentations.\n*   Students trained with random teachers develop sparse subnetworks (lottery tickets) similar to early supervised training.\n*   These students also learn to navigate to the border of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, indicating early-stage supervised learning dynamics.\n*   Initializing the student closely to the random teacher amplifies these beneficial pre-conditioning effects.\n*   The process demonstrates that label-independent optimization dynamics can explore aspects of the supervised loss landscape.",
