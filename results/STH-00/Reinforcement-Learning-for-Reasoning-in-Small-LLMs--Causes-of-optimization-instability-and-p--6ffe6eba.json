SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small language models (LLMs), specifically a 1.5-billion-parameter model, under strict computational constraints. The researchers adapted the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curated a high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset. Three experiments explored model behavior and performance. While initial training (50-100 steps) showed rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%), prolonged training led to optimization instability and performance degradation. This was attributed to factors like strict length constraints (4096 tokens) and the multilingual nature of the base model, causing language drift and truncated reasoning. Incorporating a mix of easy and hard problems and using cosine rewards helped stabilize training and control output length, though extended lengths were still needed for very complex tasks. The findings suggest that RL can significantly improve small LLMs' reasoning cost-effectively, but challenges like optimization stability and length limitations need careful management for sustained performance.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements within the first 50-100 RL fine-tuning steps, but prolonged training can lead to optimization instability and performance degradation.\n*   Strict maximum completion length constraints (e.g., 4096 tokens) are a key factor in degradation, forcing premature truncation of reasoning processes for complex problems.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model can contribute to language drift and inconsistent outputs during extended RL fine-tuning.\n*   Mixing easier problems with challenging ones and using cosine rewards can help stabilize training and manage output length, though further length extension may be needed for highly complex reasoning tasks.\n*   Despite these challenges, RL fine-tuning offers a cost-effective method to boost small LLM reasoning, achieving competitive results with minimal data and computation.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of small language models (LLMs), specifically a 1.5-billion parameter model, under strict resource constraints. The research found that RL fine-tuning can lead to rapid reasoning improvements in small LLMs, with accuracy increasing significantly within the first 50-100 training steps. However, prolonged training beyond this point, especially under tight length constraints, results in optimization instability and performance degradation. Experiment 1 demonstrated this, showing a sharp decline in accuracy after 200 steps, accompanied by increasing completion lengths and unreadable output. Experiment 2, which mixed easier and harder problems, improved initial performance and stabilized behavior but still exhibited instability late in training, suggesting that while curriculum learning helps, long-term stability remains a challenge. The multilingual nature of the base model also contributed to language drift and difficulties in enforcing English-only outputs. The cosine reward function helped stabilize completion lengths, but extended length limits were deemed necessary for very hard tasks. Overall, the study highlights a trade-off between efficiency (low data, low cost) and reasoning depth, with optimization instability and length constraints being key challenges for small LLMs.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Prolonged RL fine-tuning of small LLMs beyond 50-100 steps leads to optimization instability and performance degradation, as seen in Experiment 1.\n*   Experiment 2's use of mixed difficulty problems stabilized early reasoning but did not fully resolve late-stage instability, indicating persistent challenges with length constraints.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) contributed to issues like language drift and difficulties in enforcing monolingual output.\n*   While cosine rewards helped control output length, extremely hard tasks may require longer completion limits for optimal performance, especially with multilingual base models.\n*   There's a clear trade-off between efficiency (low data, low cost) and reasoning depth for small LLMs, with optimization instability and length constraints being critical factors.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the impact of reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning on small language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks, specifically focusing on optimization instability and performance degradation during training. Using a 1.5B parameter model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) under strict resource constraints (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24 hours), the research found that initial reasoning gains are rapid, with accuracy on AMC23 increasing from 63% to 80% within 50-100 steps. However, prolonged training beyond approximately 200 steps (or 4000 local steps) led to significant performance degradation, characterized by unstable accuracy rewards, increased completion lengths, and multilingual output drift. This degradation is attributed to challenges with strict length constraints and the multilingual nature of the base model. Experiment 2, which mixed easier and harder problems, offered better initial stability but still succumbed to late-stage instability. Experiment 3 showed that cosine rewards effectively stabilized completion lengths, but extending length limits remains crucial for very difficult tasks, especially with multilingual base models. The findings highlight a trade-off between efficiency and reasoning depth, with small LLMs achieving impressive results at low cost ($42) but facing challenges with long-term stability and complex reasoning chains.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Prolonged RL fine-tuning of small LLMs (beyond ~200 steps) can lead to optimization instability and performance degradation, including accuracy drops and multilingual output drift.\n*   Strict length constraints (e.g., 4096 tokens) are a major factor contributing to degradation, forcing premature truncation of reasoning and reward misalignment.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model exacerbates challenges, causing language drift and complicating monolingual optimization efforts.\n*   While cosine rewards improve length control and training consistency, they do not fully resolve degradation issues, suggesting a need for longer completion limits or explicit language controls for complex tasks.\n*   Small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements with limited data and computational resources, but achieving sustained performance requires careful management of training duration and output length.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints. The research focuses on a 1.5B parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, trained on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs within 24 hours. The findings reveal that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements within the first 50-100 training steps, with accuracy on AMC23 increasing from 63% to 80%. However, prolonged training beyond approximately 200 steps leads to optimization instability and performance degradation, characterized by fluctuating rewards, increasing completion lengths, and multilingual output drift. This degradation is exacerbated by strict length constraints, which can force premature truncation of reasoning processes. The cosine reward function demonstrates effectiveness in stabilizing completion lengths, but the multilingual nature of the base model presents challenges for monolingual optimization. The study highlights a trade-off between efficiency (minimal data and cost) and reasoning depth, suggesting that while RL offers a cost-effective alternative to large-scale approaches, careful management of training duration, length constraints, and base model characteristics is crucial for sustained performance.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs show rapid reasoning gains within the first 50-100 RL fine-tuning steps, but performance degrades significantly beyond approximately 200 steps due to optimization instability.\n*   Strict length constraints are a major factor contributing to performance degradation and the inability to handle complex reasoning tasks effectively.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, leads to language drift and complicates monolingual optimization during prolonged training.\n*   The cosine reward function helps stabilize completion lengths, improving training consistency, but does not fully resolve issues with complex tasks or multilingual outputs.\n*   RL fine-tuning offers significant efficiency gains in terms of data and cost compared to larger models, but achieving sustained reasoning performance requires careful management of training duration and potential interventions for instability.",

However, prolonged training can lead to optimization instability and performance degradation. Experiment 1 demonstrated that while initial gains are rapid (50-100 steps), accuracy drops significantly after 200 steps, marked by unstable rewards and increasing completion lengths, indicating reward misalignment and the impact of strict length constraints. Experiment 2, by mixing easier and harder problems with reduced length limits, improved early performance and stabilized behavior, but still experienced instability and KL divergence issues after 150-200 steps. Experiment 3 utilized a cosine reward to control output length, achieving better stability and consistency, although peak performance lagged behind Experiment 2, and multilingual base models presented challenges with language drift. Overall, the findings highlight a trade-off between efficiency and reasoning depth, with length constraints and the multilingual nature of base models being key factors affecting stability and performance degradation during RL fine-tuning.\n\n2.

Experiment 1 showed that while small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (50-100 steps), prolonged training under strict length constraints leads to performance degradation. This was evidenced by unstable accuracy rewards and increasing completion lengths, eventually resulting in unreadable content and language drift. Experiment 2, which mixed easier and harder problems and reduced length constraints, initially improved performance and stabilized behavior but still encountered instability and language issues after extended training (150-200 steps), indicated by unstable KL divergence. Experiment 3 used a cosine reward to control length, improving training consistency but highlighting the need for longer completion limits for complex tasks, especially with multilingual base models. The multilingual nature of the base model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) contributed to language drift. Overall, the research demonstrates that RL fine-tuning can be efficient and cost-effective for small LLMs, achieving competitive results with minimal data, but optimization instability and length constraints are significant challenges for sustained performance improvement.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Prolonged RL fine-tuning of small LLMs under strict length constraints leads to optimization instability and performance degradation, typically observed after 150-200 steps.\n*   Mixing easier and harder problems can stabilize early training and improve performance, but long-term stability remains an issue.\n*   Cosine rewards are effective for controlling output length and improving training consistency, but longer completion limits are necessary for complex tasks, especially with multilingual base models.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base LLM contributes to language drift and complicates monolingual optimization efforts.\n*   RL fine-tuning offers a highly efficient and cost-effective method for enhancing small LLM reasoning, but overcoming degradation requires careful management of training duration and output length.",

SUMMARY:\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small language models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints. The research found that small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning improvements within the first 50-100 training steps, demonstrated by significant accuracy gains on mathematical benchmarks. However, prolonged training beyond this point leads to optimization instability and performance degradation. This degradation is attributed to several factors: strict length constraints that force premature truncation of reasoning, reward misalignment leading to unpredictable outputs, and the multilingual nature of the base model causing language drift. Experiment 1 showed performance decline after 200 steps due to length constraints and reward misalignment. Experiment 2, by mixing easier problems, offered initial stability but still degraded later due to similar issues. Experiment 3’s use of a cosine reward effectively controlled output length, improving consistency, but the multilingual base model still presented challenges. The findings highlight a trade-off between efficiency and reasoning depth, suggesting that while RL is a cost-effective method for small LLMs, careful management of training duration, length constraints, and base model characteristics is crucial for sustained performance.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning gains rapidly (within 50-100 steps) using RL, but performance degrades with prolonged training.\n*   Optimization instability and performance degradation are triggered by strict length constraints, reward misalignment, and the multilingual nature of the base model.\n*   The cosine reward function effectively controls output length, improving training consistency, but extended length limits are still needed for complex tasks.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) contributes to language drift and complicates monolingual optimization.\n*   Despite challenges, RL-based fine-tuning offers a cost-effective and data-efficient alternative for enhancing small LLM reasoning capabilities compared to larger models.",

SUMMARY:\nThe study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small language models (LLMs) under strict resource constraints. While RL, specifically the GRPO algorithm, demonstrated rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) with minimal data and cost ($42), prolonged training led to optimization instability and performance degradation. Experiment 1 showed degradation after 200 steps, attributed to strict length constraints (4096 tokens) and reward misalignment, causing increased completion lengths and language drift. Experiment 2, mixing easy and hard problems with a reduced length limit (3584 tokens), improved initial performance but still exhibited instability and KL divergence issues after approximately 4000 local steps, suggesting the root cause of instability is related to these constraints. Experiment 3’s use of a cosine reward effectively stabilized completion lengths (1000-3500 tokens), improving training consistency, but the multilingual nature of the base model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) still led to language drift, indicating a need for explicit language controls or longer completion lengths for complex tasks. These findings highlight a trade-off between efficiency and reasoning depth, where extended training or overly strict length constraints can lead to instability in small LLMs.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Prolonged RL fine-tuning of small LLMs under strict length constraints (e.g., 4096 tokens) can lead to optimization instability and performance degradation, with issues appearing around 200 global steps or 4000 local steps.\n*   The multilingual nature of the base model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) contributes to language drift during extended training, even with explicit prompts to maintain English output.\n*   A cosine reward function effectively stabilizes output completion lengths, improving training consistency, but may not fully overcome challenges with extremely hard tasks or multilingual base models.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems can improve initial reasoning performance and stabilize behavior, but does not entirely resolve long-term instability issues under constrained training.\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements with RL and minimal data/cost, but careful management of training duration and length constraints is crucial to avoid degradation.",
