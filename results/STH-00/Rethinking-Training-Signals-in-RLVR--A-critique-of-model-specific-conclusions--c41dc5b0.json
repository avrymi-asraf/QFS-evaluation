      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis research critically examines the conclusions drawn from Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) studies, particularly highlighting how performance gains can be easily achieved through spurious reward signals, using the Qwen model family as a case study. The paper demonstrates that even weak or entirely incorrect reward signals (e.g., random rewards, incorrect labels, format rewards) can lead to substantial improvements in mathematical reasoning for Qwen2.5-Math models, often rivaling gains from ground truth rewards. Crucially, these spurious rewards do not generalize to other model families like Llama or OLMo, indicating that Qwen models possess unique pre-training characteristics that make them susceptible to such signals. The study identifies \"code reasoning\" (using Python code for mathematical thinking without execution) as a pre-existing, robust capability in Qwen models that RLVR effectively amplifies, even with spurious rewards. This suggests that RLVR might primarily be eliciting latent abilities rather than teaching new ones. The authors caution that RLVR research conclusions drawn solely from Qwen models may be misleading due to this susceptibility to spurious signals, advocating for validation across diverse model architectures.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Spurious reward signals (e.g., random, incorrect labels, format) can achieve significant performance gains in Qwen2.5-Math models during RLVR, comparable to ground truth rewards.\n*   These performance gains from spurious rewards do not generalize to other model families like Llama or OLMo, suggesting a model-specific vulnerability.\n*   Qwen models exhibit a strong pre-existing \"code reasoning\" capability that RLVR effectively amplifies, even with uninformative rewards, leading to performance improvements.\n*   The research emphasizes that RLVR might be surfacing latent abilities from pre-training rather than teaching new reasoning skills, especially when using spurious signals.\n*   The findings strongly suggest that RLVR research conclusions should be validated on diverse model families, not just Qwen, to avoid misleading results driven by spurious signals.",
