SUMMARY:\nThis paper proposes a unified geometric framework that formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" suggesting that high-level concepts in language models are represented as linear directions. It formally defines linear representation in two ways: as a subspace in the output (unembedding) space, connecting to measurement (linear probing), and as a direction in the input (embedding) space, connecting to intervention (activation steering). A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product\" which respects the independence of causally separable concepts. This inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for the construction of probes and steering vectors using counterfactual pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of these linear representations, validate the causal inner product's ability to capture semantic structure and orthogonality of separable concepts, and confirm that these representations can indeed be used for both interpreting (probing) and controlling (steering) model behavior.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis\" by defining concepts as linear directions in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces.\n*   It establishes connections between the subspace notion in the unembedding space and linear probing (measurement), and between the subspace notion in the embedding space and activation steering (intervention).\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which aims to make causally separable concepts orthogonal, and this inner product is shown to unify the embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   The framework allows for the construction of probes and steering vectors using counterfactual word pairs, and experiments confirm its validity on LLaMA-2.",

It bridges the subspace hypothesis (like word2vec analogies) with practical techniques of linear probing and activation steering. The core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which is defined by the orthogonality of representations for causally separable concepts. This causal inner product unifies two distinct formalizations of linear representation: one in the output (unembedding) space, linked to measurement (linear probing), and another in the input (embedding) space, linked to intervention (activation steering). The paper demonstrates that this unification is achieved through a Riesz isomorphism, effectively making the embedding and unembedding representations coincide. Experiments on LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations, show that the causal inner product respects semantic structure by enforcing orthogonality between separable concepts, and confirm that these representations can be used for both probing and steering. The study also highlights that the causal inner product is not inherently identified by standard training but can be estimated, and it contrasts its effectiveness with the standard Euclidean inner product.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes \"linear representation\" in both output (unembedding) and input (embedding) spaces using counterfactual pairs, linking the former to measurement/probing and the latter to intervention/steering.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, defined by orthogonality between representations of causally separable concepts, which unifies the embedding and unembedding representations via a Riesz isomorphism.\n*   Experiments on LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear concept representations and demonstrate that the estimated causal inner product correctly captures semantic orthogonality between causally independent concepts, outperforming the Euclidean inner product.\n*   The unified representations derived from the causal inner product enable effective linear probing (measurement) and activation steering (intervention) for controlling LLM behavior.",

It distinguishes between two formalizations: unembedding representations (e.g., word2vec analogies) and embedding representations (related to intervention). The core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which respects the causal separability of concepts. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, enabling geometric operations like projection and similarity to be semantically meaningful. The paper demonstrates that this causal inner product can be estimated from LM unembedding matrices and empirically validates its properties using LLaMA-2. Experiments show that concepts are indeed represented linearly as directions, that these directions act as linear probes (measurement), and that they can be used for intervention (steering) by transforming LM representations. The work highlights the critical role of the inner product choice, comparing it to the Euclidean inner product and showing its superiority in capturing semantic structure.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formally connects the subspace hypothesis (e.g., word2vec analogies) to linear probing (measurement) via unembedding representations and to activation steering (intervention) via embedding representations.\n*   A novel \"causal inner product\" is introduced, defined by the orthogonality of causally separable concepts, which unifies embedding and unembedding representations (Theorem 3.2).\n*   This causal inner product can be estimated from LM unembedding matrices and is shown to be more semantically meaningful than the Euclidean inner product, especially for capturing concept separability.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate that concept directions act as linear probes and can be used to steer model behavior, confirming the practical utility of the formalized geometric framework.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" which posits that high-level concepts are represented as linear directions in a model's representation space. It distinguishes between \"unembedding\" representations (in the output space) and \"embedding\" representations (in the input space), linking the former to measurement (linear probing) and the latter to intervention (activation steering). A core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" defined by the orthogonality of causally separable concepts. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, enabling the construction of probing and steering vectors from counterfactual pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and demonstrate that the causal inner product effectively captures semantic structure, outperforming the Euclidean inner product in aligning causally separable concepts. The work provides a geometric framework connecting subspace hypotheses (like word2vec analogies) with practical techniques for model interpretation and control.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Formalizes \"linear representation\" in both embedding (input context) and unembedding (output word) spaces, linking them to intervention and measurement (linear probing), respectively.\n*   Introduces a \"causal inner product\" that enforces orthogonality between causally separable concepts, unifying embedding and unembedding representations (Theorem 3.2).\n*   Empirically validates the linear representation hypothesis using LLaMA-2, showing that the causal inner product better respects semantic structure than the Euclidean inner product.\n*   Demonstrates how concept directions derived from counterfactual pairs can be used for both linear probing (measurement) and activation steering (intervention).",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis\" by defining linear representations in both the input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces of large language models (LLMs). It demonstrates that these distinct notions of linear representation are unified under a \"causal inner product,\" which is defined by the orthogonality of causally separable concepts. The researchers propose a method to estimate this causal inner product from the LLM's unembedding matrix and vocabulary statistics. Empirically, using LLaMA-2, they validate the existence of these linear representations. They show that these concept directions act as linear probes, connecting to the \"measurement\" interpretation. Furthermore, by transforming the unembedding representations into \"intervention\" representations via the causal inner product, they demonstrate that these can be used to steer model behavior, changing specific concepts without affecting others. The study highlights the limitations of the Euclidean inner product and emphasizes the crucial role of the causal inner product in bridging the gap between theoretical linear representations and practical LLM control techniques.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes linear representations in both embedding (input context) and unembedding (output word) spaces, linking them to intervention and measurement respectively.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which, when applied to representations, unifies the embedding and unembedding notions of linear concepts, ensuring causally separable concepts are orthogonal.\n*   Empirical results with LLaMA-2 demonstrate that these concept directions serve as linear probes (measurement) and can be used to steer model outputs (intervention), validating the proposed geometric framework.\n*   The study contrasts the causal inner product with the Euclidean inner product, showing the former better captures semantic structure and is essential for the unification and effective steering of LLM behavior.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" which posits that high-level concepts are represented as linear directions in a model's representation space. It provides two formal definitions of linear representation: one in the output (unembedding) space, linking it to measurement via linear probing, and another in the input (embedding) space, connecting it to intervention via activation steering. The core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product\" that respects the semantic separability of concepts. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for a single geometric framework. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of these linear representations and validate the connections to probing and steering. Crucially, the paper contrasts the causal inner product with the standard Euclidean inner product, showing that the former better captures semantic structure and is essential for unifying the different notions of linear representation, while the latter often fails to do so, especially in newer models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes linear representation in both embedding (input) and unembedding (output) spaces, connecting them to model intervention and measurement (probing), respectively.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which defines orthogonality for causally separable concepts, providing a unifying geometric framework for these representations.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear representations and demonstrate that the causal inner product is crucial for connecting probing and intervention, outperforming the Euclidean inner product in capturing semantic structure.\n*   Theorem 3.2 establishes that the causal inner product unifies embedding and unembedding representations, enabling a single geometric interpretation for concept manipulation.\n*   The work highlights the limitations of the Euclidean inner product in capturing semantic relationships within LLM representations, emphasizing the necessity of the causal inner product for effective interpretation and control.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" proposing that high-level concepts are represented as linear directions in a model's representation space. It establishes a geometric framework connecting the subspace hypothesis (e.g., word2vec analogies) with practical techniques like linear probing and activation steering. The core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" defined by the orthogonality of causally separable concepts. This causal inner product is shown to unify different formalizations of linear representation (in embedding and unembedding spaces) and serves as a crucial tool for both interpretation (probing) and control (steering). Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate that this causal inner product aligns with semantic structure and that concept directions derived from it can effectively predict model behavior (probing) and steer it (intervention), outperforming the standard Euclidean inner product, especially in models where the origin of representations is meaningful.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper introduces a \"causal inner product\" that formalizes the orthogonality of causally separable concepts, providing a geometric foundation to connect different linear representation notions.\n*   This causal inner product unifies \"embedding\" and \"unembedding\" representations of concepts, enabling a single geometric framework for understanding and manipulating them.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate that concept directions derived using the causal inner product serve as effective linear probes and steering vectors, demonstrating the hypothesis's practical utility.\n*   The causal inner product is empirically shown to be superior to the Euclidean inner product for capturing semantic structure and enabling control, particularly in models with meaningful representation origins.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces a unified geometric framework to connect the subspace hypothesis of linear representations (as seen in word2vec analogies) with practical techniques like linear probing and activation steering. The core contribution is the formalization of \"linear representation\" in both the input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces of language models, using counterfactual pairs. It demonstrates that the unembedding representation aligns with measurement (probing), while the embedding representation aligns with intervention (steering). A crucial element is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" defined by the orthogonality of causally separable concepts. This specific inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for a coherent geometric understanding. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these formalizations, showing that concepts are indeed represented linearly, the causal inner product respects semantic structure, and these representations can be used for both probing and steering model behavior, highlighting the limitations of the standard Euclidean inner product.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper proposes a unified geometric framework that formally connects the subspace hypothesis of linear representation (e.g., word2vec analogies) with practical techniques like linear probing and activation steering. The authors formalize \"linear representation\" in both the input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces of language models, using counterfactual pairs to define these concepts. They demonstrate that the unembedding representation relates to linear probing (measurement), while the embedding representation relates to intervention (steering). A key contribution is the definition of a \"causal inner product\" which respects the causal separability of concepts, meaning causally independent concepts are represented orthogonally. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for the construction of probes and steering vectors from counterfactual pairs. Experiments on LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear representations and show that the causal inner product effectively captures semantic structure and enables both interpretation (probing) and control (steering) of model behavior. The paper highlights the limitations of the standard Euclidean inner product and demonstrates the superiority of the causal inner product in capturing language structure.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis\" by defining concepts as linear directions in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces using counterfactual pairs.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which ensures that causally separable concepts are represented orthogonally, and this inner product unifies embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   The causal inner product is shown to be crucial for connecting linear representations to practical techniques: unembedding representations enable linear probing (measurement), and embedding representations enable activation steering (intervention).\n*   Experiments on LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and demonstrate that the causal inner product, unlike the Euclidean inner product, effectively captures semantic structure and facilitates model interpretation and control.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" which posits that high-level concepts are represented as linear directions in a model's representation space. It unifies three interpretations: subspace (word2vec analogies), measurement (linear probing), and intervention (activation steering). The core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product\" that respects the independence of causally separable concepts. This causal inner product is shown to unify the embedding and unembedding representations, bridging the gap between abstract geometric notions and practical model manipulation. The paper formally connects the unembedding representation to linear probing and the embedding representation to activation steering. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of these linear representations and validate the proposed causal inner product. The study highlights the limitations of the standard Euclidean inner product, showing that the causal inner product is crucial for accurately capturing semantic structure and enabling effective concept manipulation (steering) by ensuring orthogonality between independent concepts.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper proposes a formal geometric framework, centered on a \"causal inner product,\" that unifies the subspace (analogy), measurement (probing), and intervention (steering) notions of linear representation in LLMs.\n*   The causal inner product is defined by requiring causally separable concepts to be orthogonal, addressing the limitations of the Euclidean inner product in capturing semantic independence.\n*   Experimental validation with LLaMA-2 demonstrates that the causal inner product effectively captures semantic structure and enables accurate activation steering, while the Euclidean inner product is less effective, especially for newer models.\n*   The research formally connects the unembedding space representation to linear probing and the embedding space representation to activation steering, providing a unified theoretical basis for these techniques.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper provides a geometric framework to formally connect the subspace hypothesis of linear representation (e.g., word2vec analogies) with practical techniques like linear probing and activation steering. It defines \"linear representation\" in two ways: as a subspace in the output (unembedding) space, which connects to measurement (probing), and as a subspace in the input (embedding) space, which connects to intervention (steering). The core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product\" that respects the semantic separability of concepts. This inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for a coherent geometric understanding. The paper demonstrates that this causal inner product can be estimated from model data and empirically validates its properties using LLaMA-2. Experiments show that concepts are indeed represented linearly and that the causal inner product enables effective probing and steering, offering a unified approach to interpreting and controlling LLMs. The work highlights the limitations of the standard Euclidean inner product, which fails to capture semantic relationships as effectively as the causal inner product.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis\" by defining concepts as linear subspaces in either the embedding or unembedding spaces of LLMs, linking them to probing (measurement) and steering (intervention) respectively.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which dictates that causally separable concepts are represented orthogonally. This inner product unifies embedding and unembedding representations via a Riesz isomorphism.\n*   The causal inner product can be estimated from model data, and experiments with LLaMA-2 confirm its ability to capture semantic structure and enable effective linear probing and activation steering.\n*   The standard Euclidean inner product is shown to be insufficient for capturing semantic relationships and controlling LLM behavior, unlike the proposed causal inner product.",
