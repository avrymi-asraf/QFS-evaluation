SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates how pre-trained latent abilities influence reinforcement learning outcomes, particularly in the context of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), even with low-quality or spurious reward signals. The study reveals that models like Qwen2.5-Math can achieve significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning tasks (e.g., MATH-500) using rewards that are random, incorrectly labeled, or simply based on output format, rather than ground truth. These gains are attributed to RLVR's ability to surface and upweight pre-existing reasoning strategies learned during pre-training. A key observed strategy in Qwen2.5-Math is \"code reasoning\"â€”generating Python code to aid reasoning without actual execution. This behavior dramatically increases after RLVR, correlating directly with performance improvements. Crucially, these effects are highly model-dependent; other model families like Llama and OLMo do not benefit from spurious rewards, suggesting that the presence and elicitability of specific pre-trained abilities, such as code reasoning in Qwen models, are primary drivers of success with weak or spurious reward signals.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can elicit significant performance gains in models like Qwen2.5-Math even with spurious or random reward signals, suggesting it leverages pre-trained capabilities.\n*   The \"code reasoning\" strategy, where models generate Python code to aid mathematical thinking without execution, is a prominent pre-trained ability in Qwen2.5-Math that is amplified by RLVR, leading to improved accuracy.\n*   The effectiveness of RLVR with spurious rewards is highly model-dependent; other models like Llama and OLMo do not show similar gains, indicating that the specific pre-trained latent abilities of a model are crucial for this phenomenon.\n*   Spurious rewards work by surfacing and upweighting existing, useful reasoning patterns within a model, rather than teaching entirely new capabilities.\n*   The paper cautions that conclusions drawn from RLVR research on Qwen models may not generalize to other model families due to these underlying differences in pre-trained abilities.",
