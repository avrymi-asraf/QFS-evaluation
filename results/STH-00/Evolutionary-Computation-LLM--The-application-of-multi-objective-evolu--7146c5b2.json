SUMMARY:\nThis survey explores the application of multi-objective evolutionary principles in research that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). The research categorizes this interplay into three main avenues: LLM-enhanced EA, EA-enhanced LLM, and applications driven by their integrated synergy. Within these categories, multi-objective optimization is specifically highlighted in several contexts. For instance, in LLM-enhanced EA, multi-objective EAs (MOEAs) are employed to generate offspring for subproblems, and Quality-Diversity (QD) search, such as QDAIF and In-context QD, uses LLMs for evaluating solution quality and diversity. EA-based prompt engineering also utilizes multi-objective optimization, as seen in InstOptima and EMO-Prompts, to find Pareto fronts of optimal prompts based on multiple criteria like performance and instruction length. Furthermore, EA-based LLM architecture search frequently involves multi-objective optimization to balance metrics like accuracy and latency, with methods like LiteTransformerSearch and Klein et al. explicitly employing multi-objective EAs. Applications driven by integrated synergy also leverage multi-objective principles in areas like software project planning (SBSE) and general Neural Architecture Search (NAS).\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) are a key component in integrating LLMs and EAs, particularly in generating offspring for subproblems within LLM-enhanced EA frameworks.\n*   Quality-Diversity (QD) search, which often involves multi-objective evaluation, is utilized in conjunction with LLMs for tasks like assessing solution quality and diversity.\n*   Prompt engineering, a core area of EA-enhanced LLMs, frequently employs multi-objective optimization to find optimal prompts considering multiple criteria.\n*   Neural Architecture Search (NAS) that combines LLMs and EAs commonly uses multi-objective optimization to balance various performance metrics like accuracy and latency.\n*   Applications such as software project planning and general NAS demonstrate the use of multi-objective optimization principles when LLMs and EAs are synergistically applied.",
