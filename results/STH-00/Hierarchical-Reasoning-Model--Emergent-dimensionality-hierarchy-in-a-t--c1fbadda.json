SUMMARY:\nThe Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) is a novel recurrent architecture inspired by the brain's hierarchical and multi-timescale processing for complex reasoning tasks. It features two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module for abstract planning and a low-level module for detailed computation. This structure allows for significant computational depth while maintaining training stability and efficiency, addressing limitations of current LLMs like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). HRM achieves exceptional performance on tasks like Sudoku and maze navigation with minimal training data and no pre-training, outperforming much larger models. Crucially, the paper demonstrates that HRM, when trained, exhibits an emergent dimensionality hierarchy mirroring that found in the mouse cortex. The high-level module (zH) operates in a significantly higher-dimensional space (PR=89.95) and scales with task diversity, while the low-level module (zL) remains lower-dimensional (PR=30.22) and stable. This learned hierarchy, absent in untrained networks, suggests a fundamental organizational principle for robust reasoning, analogous to the functional organization of primate cortex where higher-order areas exhibit greater dimensionality.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   HRM employs a hierarchical, multi-timescale recurrent architecture with distinct high-level (planning) and low-level (computation) modules.\n*   HRM achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex reasoning tasks (Sudoku, Maze, ARC) with minimal data and no pre-training, unlike CoT methods.\n*   Trained HRM exhibits an emergent dimensionality hierarchy where the high-level module (zH) has significantly higher Participation Ratio (PR) and scales with task diversity, mirroring mouse cortex organization.\n*   The dimensionality hierarchy in HRM is a learned property, absent in untrained networks, suggesting it's crucial for effective reasoning.\n*   The high-to-low PR ratio in HRM (≈2.98) is comparable to that observed in the mouse cortex (≈2.25), indicating a shared organizational principle for cognitive flexibility.",
