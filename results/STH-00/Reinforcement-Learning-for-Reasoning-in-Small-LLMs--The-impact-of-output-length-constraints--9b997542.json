Using a resource-efficient Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and a curated mathematical reasoning dataset, the researchers aimed to enhance reasoning capabilities under strict computational limitations (4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 24 hours). Experiments revealed that while small LLMs can achieve rapid reasoning gains (e.g., AMC23 accuracy from 63% to 80%) with limited high-quality data and within early training stages, prolonged training under strict length constraints leads to performance degradation, optimization instability, and issues like multilingual output drift. The cosine reward function helped stabilize output lengths, but extremely hard tasks still require longer completion allowances. The findings suggest that while RL is effective for small LLMs, managing length constraints and potential base model limitations is crucial for sustained efficacy. The work highlights a cost-effective approach ($42 training cost) for developing reasoning-capable small LLMs, offering an alternative to resource-intensive methods.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Training small LLMs for complex reasoning under strict resource constraints can achieve rapid initial gains but suffers from performance degradation and instability with prolonged training, particularly due to output length limitations.\n*   The cosine reward function effectively stabilizes output lengths, contributing to more consistent training, but longer maximum completion lengths are still necessary for very difficult problems.\n*   A mix of easy and hard problems in the training data can improve early reasoning performance and stabilize behavior, though long-term stability remains a challenge.\n*   Despite limitations like multilingual output drift and truncation on complex tasks, the RL-based approach demonstrates significant cost and data efficiency ($42 training cost with 7,000 samples) compared to larger models.\n*   Small LLMs can achieve competitive reasoning performance (e.g., 46.7% on AIME24) with RL fine-tuning, offering a viable and accessible alternative for resource-constrained environments.",

Completion lengths fluctuated near 4000 tokens initially, then decreased to around 3000 tokens by 100 global steps. Post-200 steps, lengths increased again, accompanied by unreadable content and non-English outputs. This degradation suggests the model struggled with the complexity of the dataset, often exceeding the token limit. The initial length reduction reflected adaptation to the format reward, but subsequent increases and language drift indicated reward misalignment."
