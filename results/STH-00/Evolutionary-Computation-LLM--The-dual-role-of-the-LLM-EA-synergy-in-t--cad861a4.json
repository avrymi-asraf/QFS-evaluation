      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThe synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) significantly impacts model and code security. EAs can enhance LLM security by automating the generation of \"jailbreak attacks\" (AutoDAN, SMEA) to test LLM robustness and identify vulnerabilities. Conversely, LLMs can aid EAs in security tasks by generating more effective prompts for adversarial purposes, such as creating code with specified vulnerabilities (DeceptPrompt). This dual role allows for a more comprehensive approach to securing AI systems. LLMs can analyze code to identify potential security flaws that traditional methods might miss, while EAs can systematically explore the vast space of potential code modifications or prompt variations to uncover or mitigate security risks. This symbiotic relationship is crucial for developing more resilient and secure AI models and software.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   EAs can automate the generation of adversarial prompts (e.g., jailbreaks) to test LLM security and identify vulnerabilities.\n*   LLMs can assist EAs in security tasks by generating effective prompts for adversarial attacks on code, aiming to embed vulnerabilities.\n*   The combined approach allows for systematic exploration of security vulnerabilities in both LLM outputs and generated code.\n*   This synergy enables the development of more robust defenses by proactively identifying and addressing potential security weaknesses.",
