SUMMARY:\nThis paper investigates the efficacy of reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small Large Language Models (LLMs) under significant resource constraints. The researchers fine-tuned a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm on a curated, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset. Despite limitations such as a 24-hour training window on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs and a maximum completion length of 4096 tokens, the study demonstrated rapid reasoning gains, with AMC23 accuracy increasing from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%. The approach achieved this with only 7,000 samples and a minimal training cost of $42, significantly outperforming larger models and prior small LLM RL fine-tuning efforts in terms of cost and data efficiency. However, challenges like optimization instability and multilingual language drift were observed with prolonged training or insufficient length constraints, suggesting a trade-off when adapting multilingual base models for monolingual tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Small LLMs can achieve significant reasoning improvements (e.g., AMC23 from 63% to 80%) using RL, even under strict computational and data constraints (7,000 samples, $42 cost).\n*   The study identified that while early training (50-100 steps) yields rapid gains, prolonged training can lead to performance degradation and multilingual language drift, especially with insufficient length constraints.\n*   Mixing easy and hard problems in the training data helped stabilize reasoning and improve early performance, while cosine rewards proved effective for controlling output length.\n*   The research highlights the cost-effectiveness and data efficiency of RL-based fine-tuning for small LLMs compared to resource-intensive methods used for larger models.",
