      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper presents a novel approach to model merging that prioritizes structure-aware manipulation over flattened parameter methods, addressing the limitations of existing techniques like Task Arithmetic (TA). The core idea is to leverage Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on per-layer task matrices, revealing their inherent low-rank structure and identifying \"Task Singular Vectors\" (TSVs). These TSVs capture task-specific information more effectively than flat parameter vectors. The research introduces TSV-Compress (TSV-C) for efficient compression by retaining the most significant TSVs, reducing storage by 90% while preserving 99% accuracy. Furthermore, by analyzing the geometric interactions between TSVs from different tasks, the paper proposes TSV-Merge (TSV-M). This method reduces task interference by decorrelating TSVs, leading to significant performance improvements over existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with up to a 15% accuracy gain. The approach demonstrates that understanding and manipulating the structured, low-rank nature of layer-wise weight differences is crucial for effective and interference-free model merging.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The paper advocates for structure-aware model manipulation by analyzing per-layer task matrices using SVD, identifying Task Singular Vectors (TSVs), as a superior alternative to flattened parameter approaches.\n*   TSV-Compress (TSV-C) demonstrates effective compression by retaining key TSVs, reducing task vector size by 90% while maintaining 99% accuracy.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) reduces task interference by decorrelating TSVs, significantly outperforming existing model merging techniques and achieving state-of-the-art results.\n*   The research highlights that task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs can represent a layer's function with high fidelity.\n*   The proposed method offers a more fine-grained understanding and mitigation of task interference by examining the geometric interactions of singular vectors across tasks.",
