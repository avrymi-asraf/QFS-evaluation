SUMMARY:\nThe article introduces rStar-Math, a novel approach that enables small language models (SLMs) to achieve state-of-the-art math reasoning capabilities by employing \"deep thinking\" through Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). A key innovation is a new method for training process reward models (PRMs) that bypasses the need for noisy, step-level score annotations. Instead, rStar-Math trains a Process Preference Model (PPM) by constructing preference pairs based on Q-values derived from MCTS rollouts. This PPM leverages the ability of Q-values to reliably distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning steps, even if precise scoring is difficult. The method involves a self-evolutionary recipe where the policy SLM and PPM are iteratively improved over four rounds, generating increasingly high-quality, step-by-step verified reasoning trajectories through code-augmented Chain-of-Thought (CoT) synthesis. This process significantly enhances the math reasoning performance of SLMs, enabling them to rival or surpass larger models like OpenAI's o1 on challenging benchmarks.\n\n2.
