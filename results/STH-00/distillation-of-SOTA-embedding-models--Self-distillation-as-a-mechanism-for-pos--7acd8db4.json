SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a novel 2 billion parameter embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art performance by employing a multi-stage distillation framework to learn from multiple larger teacher models. The core of this framework is a distillation process that utilizes three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. These losses progressively transfer knowledge from teacher models to the student model, moving from specific to broader semantic alignment. To address the challenge of high vector dimensionality in leading embedding models, Jasper incorporates Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for effective dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, the paper details a self-distillation mechanism for post-hoc modality alignment, specifically for integrating vision capabilities by aligning image embeddings with textual embeddings. Jasper's performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) demonstrates its ability to rival 7 billion parameter models, significantly outperforming other models in its parameter class.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n* Jasper employs a multi-stage distillation framework with cosine, similarity, and relative similarity losses to learn from multiple large teacher models.\n* Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is used to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model.\n* A self-distillation mechanism is proposed for post-hoc modality alignment between visual and textual embeddings.\n* Jasper (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB benchmark.",
