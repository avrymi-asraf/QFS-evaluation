SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework designed to systematically assess how heavily Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on superficial cues in evaluation datasets, rather than true language understanding. The core methodology involves generating perturbed versions of benchmark prompts using a parametric rephrasing tool that modifies wording while preserving semantic content and labels. By evaluating LLMs on both original and perturbed datasets and applying statistical tests (McNemar's test), C-BOD quantifies performance degradation under textual variations. The framework aims to detect overfitting to specific prompt formats, a phenomenon that can lead to inflated benchmark scores. Experiments on the MMLU benchmark with 26 LLMs revealed that most models experienced a performance drop, with larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy showing greater sensitivity to rephrasing. This indicates a widespread reliance on memorized patterns, challenging the reliability of current leaderboard-based evaluations and highlighting the need for more robust, surface-invariant assessment methods. C-BOD is presented as a dataset- and model-agnostic tool that can be integrated into training pipelines to promote more generalizable language understanding.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   C-BOD is a meta-evaluation framework that systematically distorts benchmark prompts via parametric transformations to detect LLM overfitting to dataset-specific surface cues.\n*   The method generates perturbed inputs that preserve semantic content and labels but alter wording, allowing for the quantification of performance degradation.\n*   Experiments on MMLU showed that a majority of LLMs (20 out of 26) exhibited statistically significant performance drops under modest rephrasing, indicating reliance on memorized patterns.\n*   Larger models and those with higher baseline accuracy tended to be more sensitive to prompt perturbations, suggesting they overfit more to fixed prompt patterns.\n*   C-BOD is designed to be dataset- and model-agnostic, enabling its integration into training pipelines to foster more robust language understanding.",
