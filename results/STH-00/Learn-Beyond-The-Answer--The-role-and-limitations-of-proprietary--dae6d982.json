SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces \"Reflective Augmentation\" (RefAug), a novel technique to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) research in mathematical reasoning by incorporating \"reflection\" into training data. Unlike traditional data augmentation that simply expands the dataset with more problem instances, RefAug augments existing instances by appending a \"reflective section\" to the original solution. This section comprises \"alternative reasoning\" (different solution approaches) and \"follow-up reasoning\" (generalizations or analogies to related problems). The core aim is to foster deeper understanding and improve performance in complex, reflective reasoning scenarios beyond standard single-round question-answering. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance on both standard and reflective math reasoning tasks, and it is complementary to existing data augmentation methods, leading to further gains. The method also shows promise in code generation. While proprietary models like GPT-4 are used for annotation, the research acknowledges the potential of stronger open-source models to reduce reliance on paid services.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LLM mathematical reasoning by adding \"reflection\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) to training data, promoting deeper understanding.\n*   It improves performance on both standard single-round QA and complex reflective reasoning tasks, outperforming traditional data expansion methods in the latter.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, yielding synergistic performance improvements when combined.\n*   The technique is effective across different LLM architectures and shows promise for code generation tasks.\n*   While proprietary models are used for annotation, the research notes the trend towards stronger open-source models for data generation.",
