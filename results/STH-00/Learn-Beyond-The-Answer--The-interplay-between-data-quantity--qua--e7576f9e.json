SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces \"reflective augmentation\" (RefAug) as a novel technique to enhance language models' (LMs) mathematical reasoning capabilities, particularly addressing limitations of traditional data augmentation methods. While existing approaches focus on increasing data quantity and diversity (e.g., question or answer augmentation), RefAug embeds problem reflection within training instances. This involves appending \"alternative reasoning\" (different solution paths) and \"follow-up reasoning\" (generalizations or analogies) to existing problem-solution pairs. Experiments show RefAug significantly boosts performance on standard single-round math problems, achieving a +7.2 accuracy gain. Crucially, it markedly improves performance on more complex reflective reasoning tasks (like follow-up questions and error correction) where traditional methods falter. RefAug also complements existing data expansion techniques, leading to synergistic gains. The method is effective across different model sizes and even shows promise in code generation, demonstrating that incorporating reflection into training data is key to deeper mathematical understanding and more robust reasoning, rather than solely increasing data volume. The quality of reflection data, even when generated by advanced LMs, is shown to be crucial for achieving these benefits.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Reflective augmentation (RefAug) enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by adding alternative and follow-up reasoning to training data, going beyond simple data quantity increases.\n*   RefAug improves performance on standard math problems (+7.2 accuracy) and significantly boosts capabilities in complex reflective reasoning tasks, where traditional augmentation methods fall short.\n*   RefAug is complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, leading to synergistic performance gains.\n*   The approach is effective for both mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks, suggesting reflection is a fundamental aspect of problem-solving.\n*   While data quantity is important, the *quality* and *nature* of the data (i.e., incorporating reflection) are critical for developing deeper understanding and more flexible reasoning in LMs.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel training technique for language models (LMs) that enhances mathematical reasoning by embedding problem reflection into training instances. Unlike traditional data augmentation that increases data quantity, RefAug enriches the *quality* of each instance by adding alternative and follow-up reasoning sections. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance on standard single-round math problems, achieving a +7.2 accuracy gain.

RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to synergistic improvements. An ablation study confirms that both alternative and follow-up reasoning components contribute to performance, with their combination being most effective. Furthermore, RefAug proves effective in code generation tasks, enhancing instruction following. The study also highlights that while data quantity from methods like Q-Aug and A-Aug shows diminishing returns, RefAug consistently provides gains, suggesting a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts.

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel training technique for language models (LMs) designed to enhance mathematical reasoning beyond simple answer generation. RefAug embeds problem reflection into training instances by appending \"alternative reasoning\" and \"follow-up reasoning\" sections to existing solutions. This approach aims to cultivate a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and methodologies, enabling LMs to tackle more complex, reflective reasoning scenarios that traditional data augmentation methods struggle with. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly improves performance on both standard single-round math QA tasks (outperforming direct fine-tuning by +7.2 accuracy) and reflective reasoning tasks (e.g., follow-up questions, error correction), where it shows substantial gains over methods like Question Augmentation (Q-Aug) and Answer Augmentation (A-Aug). Crucially, RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to synergistic gains and mitigating the diminishing returns observed with simply increasing data quantity. The method also shows promise in code generation tasks. An error analysis indicates that RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors, underscoring its role in deepening conceptual understanding.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LM performance on both standard and complex reflective math reasoning tasks, outperforming traditional data augmentation methods in the latter.\n*   RefAug complements existing data expansion techniques (Q-Aug, A-Aug), leading to synergistic performance gains and addressing diminishing returns from data quantity alone.\n*   The method specifically targets reasoning errors, suggesting an improvement in the LM's deeper understanding of mathematical principles.\n*   RefAug's effectiveness is observed in code generation tasks, indicating its broad applicability in problem-solving domains requiring logical reasoning.\n*   The structure of RefAug (appending reflection after the answer) is crucial for its effectiveness in reflective reasoning, unlike integrating it into a chain-of-thought structure.",

Unlike traditional data augmentation that increases the sheer volume of training data, RefAug enriches each training instance with \"reflection\" – alternative approaches and follow-up reasoning scenarios. Experiments show that RefAug significantly boosts performance on standard single-round math problems, achieving a +7.2 accuracy gain. Crucially, it dramatically improves performance on complex reflective reasoning tasks (e.g., follow-up questions, error correction), areas where traditional augmentation methods fall short. RefAug also demonstrates strong complementary benefits, leading to further substantial gains when combined with existing techniques. The study also explores RefAug's effectiveness in code generation, showing consistent improvements. An analysis of annotator quality reveals that while LLaMA-3 can provide some benefits, GPT-4's annotations lead to superior performance, especially in reflective tasks, suggesting that higher quality data is needed for deeper reasoning capabilities. RefAug's impact is primarily in reducing reasoning errors rather than calculation errors.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LM performance on both standard math problems (+7.2 accuracy) and complex reflective reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming traditional data expansion.\n*   RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing augmentation methods, leading to synergistic gains and overcoming diminishing returns from simply increasing data quantity.\n*   RefAug improves performance in code generation tasks, indicating its broader applicability beyond pure mathematics.\n*   The quality of data annotation impacts performance, with GPT-4-annotated data yielding better results than LLaMA-3, particularly for reflective reasoning.\n*   RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors, suggesting it deepens the model's understanding of mathematical concepts and logic.",

Unlike traditional data augmentation methods that expand the training set with more problems, RefAug enriches each training instance with a \"reflective section\" containing alternative and follow-up reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly improves LM performance on standard single-round math problems, achieving a +7.2 accuracy gain. Crucially, it also substantially boosts performance on more complex reflective reasoning tasks (e.g., follow-up questions, error correction), where traditional methods fall short. RefAug exhibits complementary benefits, leading to further synergistic gains when combined with existing augmentation techniques, effectively mitigating the diminishing returns often seen with simple data expansion. The study also shows RefAug's effectiveness in code generation tasks and highlights that while GPT-4-annotated data yields superior results for reflective tasks compared to LLaMA-3, RefAug generally improves performance across different annotator qualities. Error analysis indicates that RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors, suggesting a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LM performance on both standard math reasoning (+7.2 accuracy) and complex reflective reasoning tasks, where traditional methods falter.\n*   RefAug complements existing data augmentation techniques, yielding synergistic gains and mitigating diminishing returns from data quantity expansion.\n*   The method is effective in code generation tasks, demonstrating its broad applicability beyond pure mathematics.\n*   RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors in LMs, indicating a deeper comprehension of mathematical principles rather than just pattern matching.\n*   While GPT-4-annotated reflective data shows higher efficacy for reflective tasks than LLaMA-3, RefAug generally improves performance regardless of annotator quality.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel technique for fine-tuning language models (LMs) for mathematical tasks. RefAug enhances training data by embedding \"reflection\" into each instance, encouraging LMs to consider alternative perspectives and engage with abstractions or analogies. This approach moves beyond simply increasing data quantity through traditional augmentation methods like question or answer augmentation. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly improves performance on both standard single-round math problems (+7.2 accuracy gain) and complex reflective reasoning tasks (e.g., +22.3 accuracy gain in error correction), where traditional methods fall short. Crucially, RefAug offers complementary benefits, leading to even greater performance gains when combined with existing data expansion techniques, effectively counteracting diminishing returns from simply scaling data quantity. The method also proves effective in code generation. An analysis of annotator quality reveals that while LLaMA-3 can generate useful RefAug data for standard tasks, GPT-4's annotations lead to superior performance on reflective reasoning tasks, indicating a higher data quality requirement for deeper reasoning skills.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LM performance on mathematical tasks by incorporating \"reflection\" (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data, improving both standard and reflective reasoning abilities.\n*   RefAug demonstrates complementary benefits, yielding synergistic gains when combined with existing data augmentation methods, and effectively addresses the diminishing returns of simply increasing data quantity.\n*   While traditional data augmentation struggles with reflective reasoning tasks, RefAug significantly boosts performance in these complex scenarios.\n*   The quality of data annotation impacts performance, with GPT-4's annotations leading to better results on reflective tasks compared to LLaMA-3, suggesting a higher data quality need for advanced reasoning.\n*   RefAug is also effective in code generation tasks, indicating its broader applicability beyond mathematical reasoning.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces \"reflective augmentation\" (RefAug), a novel technique to enhance language model (LM) performance on mathematical tasks by embedding problem reflection into training data. Unlike traditional data augmentation that simply increases the quantity of training instances, RefAug focuses on the *quality* of learning by incorporating alternative reasoning and follow-up scenarios into each training example. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance on standard single-round math problems (improving accuracy by +7.2) and, crucially, excels in more complex reflective reasoning tasks (e.g., error correction, follow-up questions) where traditional methods fall short. RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing data expansion techniques, yielding synergistic gains. The study also explores RefAug's effectiveness in code generation, showing consistent improvements. An analysis comparing GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 for annotation reveals that higher-quality annotators (GPT-4) lead to greater gains, particularly in reflective tasks, suggesting that data quality is paramount for complex reasoning. Furthermore, the error analysis indicates RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors, not calculation errors, underscoring its impact on deeper understanding.\n\n2.

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel technique for fine-tuning language models on mathematical tasks. Unlike traditional data augmentation that solely increases the quantity of training examples, RefAug enriches each instance with \"reflective\" components, such as alternative reasoning paths and follow-up scenarios (generalizations or analogies). This approach aims to cultivate a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and problem-solving methodologies. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly enhances performance on standard single-round math problems, achieving a notable accuracy gain. Crucially, RefAug excels in improving performance on more complex, reflective reasoning tasks (like error correction and multi-turn problem-solving) where traditional augmentation methods falter. The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing augmentation techniques, leading to synergistic gains. Furthermore, RefAug shows promise in code generation tasks and effectively mitigates the diminishing returns often seen with simply increasing data quantity. An analysis indicates that RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors, suggesting a deeper learning of mathematical principles. The quality of annotations, with GPT-4 generally outperforming LLaMA-3 for reflective tasks, impacts the model's ability to handle complex reasoning.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances both standard and reflective mathematical reasoning by incorporating problem reflection (alternative and follow-up reasoning) into training data, unlike traditional quantity-focused augmentation.\n*   RefAug provides complementary benefits to existing data augmentation methods, leading to synergistic performance gains, particularly in complex reflective reasoning scenarios where other methods are less effective.\n*   The technique improves performance by reducing reasoning errors, indicating a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts rather than just memorizing solutions.\n*   While RefAug is effective for code generation and scales well with data, the quality of data annotation (e.g., GPT-4 vs. LLaMA-3) significantly impacts performance on reflective reasoning tasks.\n*   RefAug offers a solution to the diminishing returns of data quantity augmentation by focusing on the quality and depth of learning per instance.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces \"reflective augmentation\" (RefAug) as a novel technique to enhance language models (LMs) for mathematical reasoning. Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the training set with more problems, RefAug enriches each training instance with \"reflection,\" comprising alternative and follow-up reasoning. This approach aims to foster a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and problem-solving methodologies, moving beyond rote memorization. Experiments demonstrate that RefAug significantly boosts performance in both standard single-round question-answering (QA) tasks (achieving a +7.2 accuracy gain) and more complex reflective reasoning scenarios (like error correction and multi-turn question answering), where traditional methods often falter. RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to synergistic gains. The study also shows RefAug's effectiveness in code generation and its scalability, with performance improving as more data is augmented. Ablation studies confirm that both alternative and follow-up reasoning components contribute to the gains, with the latter particularly crucial for deeper understanding. The quality of data annotation (GPT-4 vs. LLaMA-3) impacts performance, with GPT-4-annotated data yielding better results, especially for reflective tasks.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LMs' mathematical reasoning by adding reflective components (alternative and follow-up reasoning) to training data, improving deep understanding beyond just problem quantity.\n*   RefAug provides significant accuracy gains (+7.2) in standard math QA and substantially improves performance on complex reflective reasoning tasks where traditional augmentation methods are less effective.\n*   The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing data expansion techniques, leading to synergistic performance improvements and mitigating diminishing returns from simply increasing data size.\n*   RefAug is effective in code generation tasks and its impact scales with the percentage of augmented data, with both alternative and follow-up reasoning components contributing to performance.\n*   Higher quality annotation (e.g., GPT-4 vs. LLaMA-3) for RefAug data leads to better performance, particularly in reflective reasoning tasks, suggesting that data quality is crucial for deeper learning.",

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel technique to enhance language models' mathematical reasoning by embedding problem reflection into training data. Unlike traditional methods that expand datasets with more examples, RefAug enriches each instance with \"alternative reasoning\" (different solution paths) and \"follow-up reasoning\" (generalizations or analogies). Experiments show RefAug significantly boosts performance on standard single-round math tasks (+7.2 accuracy gain) and, crucially, excels in more complex reflective reasoning scenarios (e.g., follow-up questions, error correction) where traditional augmentation methods falter. RefAug's benefits are complementary, leading to even greater gains when combined with existing techniques like Answer Augmentation and MetaMath. The study also demonstrates RefAug's effectiveness in code generation and highlights its ability to reduce reasoning errors. Notably, even a small percentage of RefAug data can yield substantial improvements, and its impact is more pronounced in reflective tasks compared to data quantity alone, countering the diminishing returns seen with simple data expansion.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances both standard math problem-solving and complex reflective reasoning, surpassing traditional data expansion methods in the latter.\n*   RefAug's gains are complementary to existing augmentation techniques, leading to synergistic performance improvements.\n*   The inclusion of alternative and follow-up reasoning components in RefAug is crucial for deepening understanding and improving performance, particularly in reflective tasks.\n*   RefAug effectively reduces reasoning errors, indicating a more profound improvement in mathematical understanding beyond mere calculation.\n*   While data quantity from traditional augmentation shows diminishing returns, RefAug demonstrates consistent benefits and scalability, even with partial application.",

Unlike traditional data augmentation that expands the training set with more problems, RefAug enriches each training instance with a reflective section, including alternative perspectives and follow-up reasoning. This approach deepens the model's understanding of mathematical concepts and methodologies, leading to improved performance in both standard single-round question-answering (QA) and more complex reflective reasoning scenarios. Experiments show that RefAug provides significant accuracy gains (+7.2 on average) over direct fine-tuning in standard QA.

RefAug also demonstrates complementary benefits, synergizing with existing data expansion techniques for even greater gains, and mitigating the diminishing returns often seen with simply increasing data quantity. The method is also effective in code generation. An analysis of RefAug components reveals that both alternative and follow-up reasoning contribute to performance, with their combination yielding the best results.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel method to enhance language model (LM) performance on mathematical tasks by embedding problem reflection into training data. Unlike traditional data augmentation that focuses on increasing data quantity, RefAug enriches each training instance with \"alternative reasoning\" and \"follow-up reasoning\" components. Experiments show that RefAug significantly boosts performance on standard single-round question-answering (QA) tasks, achieving a +7.2 accuracy gain. Crucially, RefAug demonstrates superior effectiveness in complex reflective reasoning scenarios (e.g., follow-up questions, error correction) where traditional methods fall short, providing gains up to +22.3. RefAug is complementary to existing augmentation techniques, leading to synergistic improvements. The study also found that while increasing data quantity (like with MetaMath) exhibits diminishing returns, RefAug continues to provide benefits even on large datasets. Analyzing the components of RefAug, both alternative and follow-up reasoning contribute to performance gains, with their combination being most effective. Furthermore, RefAug proves effective in code generation tasks.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Reflective Augmentation (RefAug), a novel technique to enhance language model (LM) performance on mathematical tasks by embedding problem reflection into training data. Unlike traditional data augmentation that increases data quantity, RefAug enriches the quality and depth of understanding for each instance by including alternative and follow-up reasoning. Experiments show that RefAug significantly boosts performance on standard single-round math reasoning tasks, achieving a +7.2 accuracy gain. Crucially, it excels in more complex reflective reasoning scenarios (like follow-up questions and error correction), where traditional methods falter. RefAug's benefits are complementary to existing augmentation techniques, leading to synergistic gains. Furthermore, the approach is effective in code generation and demonstrates scalability. Ablation studies confirm that both alternative and follow-up reasoning components contribute to performance, with the combination yielding the best results. The study also highlights that while data quantity expansion shows diminishing returns, RefAug effectively deepens model understanding, even on large datasets like MetaMath.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   RefAug enhances LMs for mathematical tasks by adding reflective reasoning (alternative and follow-up) to training data, improving performance beyond simple data quantity increases.\n*   RefAug provides a significant accuracy gain (+7.2) on standard math reasoning tasks and markedly improves performance on complex reflective reasoning tasks where traditional augmentation methods are less effective.\n*   The benefits of RefAug are complementary to existing data augmentation techniques, leading to synergistic performance improvements and overcoming diminishing returns from simply expanding data quantity.\n*   Both alternative and follow-up reasoning components of RefAug contribute to performance, with their combination proving most effective, and the method also shows promise in code generation.\n*   Error analysis indicates RefAug primarily reduces reasoning errors, suggesting it fosters a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and problem-solving methodologies.",
