SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices to address task interference in model merging. The authors observe that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs can represent the layer's function with high fidelity. This observation leads to TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a method that compresses task vectors to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% accuracy. More importantly for the user's query, the paper proposes TSV-Merge (TSV-M), a novel model merging approach that leverages the low-rank space of TSVs. TSV-M combines compression with interference reduction by decorrelating TSVs from different tasks using an orthogonal Procrustes transformation. This decorrelation directly minimizes task interference, leading to significantly improved performance compared to existing methods. The approach effectively reduces interference by aligning singular vectors to minimize cross-task interactions, establishing a new state-of-the-art in model merging.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) are extracted from the SVD of per-layer task matrices, revealing their low-rank nature.\n*   TSV-Merge (TSV-M) decorrelates TSVs from different tasks using an orthogonal Procrustes transformation to reduce task interference.\n*   This decorrelation aims to minimize cross-task interactions in the singular vector space, a key mechanism for improving model merging.\n*   The method demonstrably reduces task interference, leading to significant accuracy gains and outperforming existing model merging techniques.",

The core idea is that these singular vectors, representing task-specific feature bases, can be manipulated to reduce interference. The authors propose TSV-Merge (TSV-M), a novel model merging approach that leverages the low-rank nature of these task matrices. A key component of TSV-M is the application of a whitening transformation to decorrelate the TSVs from different tasks. This decorrelation is formulated as an orthogonal Procrustes problem, which seeks an orthogonal matrix that minimizes the projection error. The paper demonstrates that this orthogonalization, when applied to the low-rank approximations of task matrices, leads to better performance than when applied to full-rank matrices due to reduced approximation errors, as formalized in Theorem 6.1. This process effectively reduces inter-task interference by making the task-specific feature bases orthogonal, thereby improving the overall performance of the merged model.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Orthogonal Procrustes analysis is used to decorrelate Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) from different tasks in TSV-Merge, reducing inter-task interference.\n*   Theorem 6.1 establishes that applying Procrustes orthonormalization to low-rank approximations of TSVs results in lower approximation errors compared to full-rank matrices.\n*   Decorrelating TSVs via Procrustes ensures that task-specific feature bases are made orthogonal, minimizing interference during model merging.\n*   The method demonstrates that combining low-rank approximation with interference reduction (via orthogonalization) significantly outperforms approaches that only use one of these techniques.\n*   The proof of whitening-Procrustes equivalence confirms the theoretical underpinnings of the interference reduction mechanism.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Task Singular Vectors (TSV) derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices to address task interference in model merging. The core idea is that these singular vectors, representing task-specific feature bases, can be manipulated to reduce interference. The authors propose TSV-Merge (TSV-M), a novel model merging approach that leverages the low-rank nature of these task matrices. A key component of TSV-M is the application of a whitening transformation to decorrelate the TSVs from different tasks. This decorrelation is formulated as an orthogonal Procrustes problem, which seeks an orthogonal matrix that minimizes the projection error. The paper demonstrates that this orthogonalization, when applied to the low-rank approximations of task matrices, leads to better performance than when applied to full-rank matrices due to reduced approximation errors, as formalized in Theorem 6.1. This process effectively reduces inter-task interference by making the task-specific feature bases orthogonal, thereby improving the overall performance of the merged model.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Orthogonal Procrustes analysis is used to decorrelate Task Singular Vectors (TSVs) from different tasks in TSV-Merge, reducing inter-task interference.\n*   Theorem 6.1 establishes that applying Procrustes orthonormalization to low-rank approximations of TSVs results in lower approximation errors compared to full-rank matrices.\n*   Decorrelating TSVs via Procrustes ensures that task-specific feature bases are made orthogonal, minimizing interference during model merging.\n*   The method demonstrates that combining low-rank approximation with interference reduction (via orthogonalization) significantly outperforms approaches that only use one of these techniques.\n*   The proof of whitening-Procrustes equivalence confirms the theoretical underpinnings of the interference reduction mechanism.",
