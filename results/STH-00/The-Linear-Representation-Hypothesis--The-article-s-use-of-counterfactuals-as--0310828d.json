The authors introduce counterfactuals as a formal language to define and connect different intuitions about linear representations: subspace, measurement, and intervention. They propose two formalizations of linear representation, one in the output (unembedding) space and one in the input (embedding) space, both anchored in counterfactual pairs. A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product\" which, when applied to the unembedding space, unifies these disparate notions of linear representation. This unification allows for the construction of both measurement (probing) and intervention (steering) representations from counterfactual pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of these linear representations, validate the causal inner product's ability to capture semantic structure and causally separable concepts, and confirm the connection between subspace representations and their utility in model interpretation and control.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactuals are used as a formal language to define and connect three notions of linear representation: subspace, measurement, and intervention.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which unifies unembedding (output) and embedding (input) representations by ensuring causally separable concepts are orthogonal.\n*   The paper demonstrates that these formalized linear representations can be used for both interpreting (measuring) and controlling (steering) language model behavior.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic structure.",

A key contribution is the definition of a \"causal inner product,\" which establishes orthogonality between representations of causally separable concepts. This causal inner product is shown to unify the embedding and unembedding representations, effectively bridging the gap between these two perspectives. The paper demonstrates empirically with LLaMA-2 that these counterfactual-based representations exist, that the causal inner product respects semantic structure by showing orthogonality for separable concepts, and that these representations can be used for model interpretation (measurement) and control (intervention).\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactual pairs are used to formally define linear representations in both unembedding (output) and embedding (input) spaces, linking them to measurement and intervention respectively.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, requiring that representations of causally separable concepts are orthogonal.\n*   The causal inner product unifies the unembedding and embedding representations, providing a single geometric framework.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations and the properties of the causal inner product, demonstrating their utility for interpretation and control.\n*   The paper shows that embedding representations, derived through the causal inner product, directly enable intervention by altering model behavior without affecting causally separable concepts.",

The authors introduce counterfactual pairs as a formal language to define linear representations in both \"unembedding\" (output word) and \"embedding\" (input context) spaces.

A key contribution is the concept of a \"causal inner product,\" defined by the orthogonality of causally separable concepts. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, transforming them into a single representation space where geometric notions like similarity and projection become semantically meaningful. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these formalizations, demonstrating that counterfactual pairs define concept directions, the causal inner product respects semantic structure by showing orthogonality for separable concepts, and these representations can be used for both interpretation (measurement) and control (intervention).\n\n2.

The authors introduce counterfactuals as a formal language to define linear representations in both the \"unembedding\" (output word) space and the \"embedding\" (input context) space. They demonstrate that these two formalizations correspond to the notions of measurement (linear probing) and intervention (model steering), respectively. A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" defined by the orthogonality of representations for causally separable concepts. This causal inner product is shown to unify the embedding and unembedding representations, providing a coherent geometric framework. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these formalizations, showing that counterfactual pairs indeed define linear subspaces, that the causal inner product respects semantic structure by making causally separable concepts orthogonal, and that these representations can be used for both interpretation (probing) and control (steering) of model behavior.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactual pairs are used to formally define linear representations in both unembedding (output) and embedding (input) spaces, linking them to measurement and intervention, respectively.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, characterized by the orthogonality of representations for causally separable concepts.\n*   This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, providing a consistent geometric framework for understanding linear representations.\n*   Experiments validate that these linear representations exist, the causal inner product captures semantic structure, and they enable model interpretation and control.",

It defines linear representations in both the unembedding (output) and embedding (input) spaces, linking them to measurement and intervention respectively. The core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product\" which unifies these two notions by enforcing orthogonality between representations of causally separable concepts. This unified perspective allows for a consistent understanding of geometric operations like similarity and projection. The paper demonstrates empirically with LLaMA-2 that concepts are indeed represented linearly as directions in the unembedding space, and that the proposed causal inner product correctly captures semantic structure by ensuring orthogonality for causally independent concepts. Furthermore, the derived embedding representations, leveraging the causal inner product, are shown to effectively enable model control through intervention, altering specific conceptual attributes without affecting others.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactual pairs are used to formally define linear representations in both unembedding (linking to measurement) and embedding (linking to intervention) spaces.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which unifies unembedding and embedding representations by enforcing orthogonality between representations of causally separable concepts.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear representations and demonstrate that the causal inner product captures semantic structure by aligning causally separable concepts with orthogonal vectors.\n*   The derived embedding representations, based on the causal inner product, successfully facilitate intervention, allowing targeted manipulation of specific concepts within the model's output.",

The authors use counterfactuals as a formal language to define linear representations in both output (unembedding) and input (embedding) spaces. The unembedding representation is shown to connect to the \"measurement\" notion, where a concept's value is predicted linearly. The embedding representation is linked to the \"intervention\" notion, where concepts can be manipulated by adding vectors. A key contribution is the definition of a \"causal inner product,\" which ensures that causally separable concepts are orthogonal. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, providing a single framework for understanding and manipulating linear representations. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate these formalizations, demonstrating the existence of linear representations for concepts, the connection between representations and model control, and the crucial role of the causal inner product in respecting semantic structure and unifying different notions of linear representation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactual pairs are used to formally define linear representations in both unembedding (output) and embedding (input) spaces.\n*   The unembedding representation is linked to measurement (probing), while the embedding representation is linked to intervention (steering).\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which enforces orthogonality between representations of causally separable concepts and unifies embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate that concepts are indeed represented linearly and that the causal inner product effectively captures semantic structure and enables controlled interventions.",

Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear representations for various concepts, demonstrate the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic structure and enabling control, and confirm the connections between the different formalizations of linear representation.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Counterfactual pairs are used to formally define linear representations in both the unembedding (output) and embedding (input) spaces of language models, linking them to measurement and intervention respectively.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which ensures that causally separable concepts are represented by orthogonal vectors, thereby unifying embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear representations, the utility of the causal inner product for understanding semantic structure, and the ability to use these representations for model interpretation and control.\n*   Theorem 2.5 establishes a direct link between the embedding representation and intervention, demonstrating that adding an embedding representation to a model's context vector steers the model towards a specific concept without affecting causally separable ones.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" which posits that high-level concepts are represented linearly in language models. The authors introduce counterfactual pairs as a formal language to define linear representations in both the \"unembedding\" (output word) space and the \"embedding\" (input context) space. The unembedding representation is shown to connect to measurement (linear probing), and the embedding representation to intervention (model steering). A key contribution is the definition of a \"causal inner product\" that enforces orthogonality between representations of causally separable concepts. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for the construction of probes and steering vectors using counterfactual pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear representations for various concepts, demonstrate the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic structure and enabling control, and confirm the connections between the different formalizations of linear representation.\n\n2.
