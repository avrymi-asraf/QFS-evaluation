SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces a novel approach to model merging that leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of per-layer task matrices to understand and mitigate task interference. The authors identify \"Task Singular Vectors\" (TSVs) from the SVD that capture task-specific information. They observe that these task matrices are inherently low-rank, meaning a small subset of TSVs can represent a task effectively. This insight leads to TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a compression method that reduces task vector size by 90% while retaining 99% accuracy. Crucially, the alignment of TSVs from different tasks is proposed as a geometric measure of task interference. By decorrelating these singular vectors through a whitening transformation, TSV-Merge (TSV-M) effectively reduces interference, leading to state-of-the-art performance in model merging, outperforming existing methods by a significant margin. The geometric interpretation of task interference through TSV alignment provides a more granular understanding of inter-task interactions compared to traditional cosine similarity.\n\n2.
