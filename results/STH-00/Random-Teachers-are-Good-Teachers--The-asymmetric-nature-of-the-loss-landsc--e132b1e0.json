The core experiment uses a randomly initialized teacher model instead of a trained one, stripping away \"dark knowledge\" and standard data augmentation. Surprisingly, even with a random teacher, the student model exhibits significant improvements in representation quality, as measured by linear probing accuracy. This indicates that the learning dynamics themselves, rather than specific teacher knowledge or data augmentation, are crucial for feature learning. The study also highlights that initializing the student closely to the teacher amplifies this implicit regularization. The research explores the loss landscape and finds that this proximity to a random teacher leads the student to settle in a local minimum that boasts high probing accuracy, distinct from the teacher's (random) initialization. This phenomenon suggests that even early phases of supervised training might be mimicked by label-independent dynamics, navigating the loss landscape in a way that develops sparse subnetworks and reaches the edge of linear basins, similar to findings in lottery ticket research.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   Students trained with random teachers (without dark knowledge or augmentation) still learn meaningful representations and outperform their teachers in probing accuracy.\n*   Initializing the student closely to the random teacher amplifies the learning process and its resulting representation quality.\n*   The loss landscape around a random teacher exhibits an asymmetric valley, where moving away from the teacher (towards the student's learned solution) leads to a steep loss increase in one direction and a gradual increase in another, coinciding with high probing accuracy.\n*   Student models trained with random teachers develop sparse subnetworks and reside at the border of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape, mimicking early stages of supervised training without explicit labels.\n*   These findings suggest that the implicit regularization inherent in gradient dynamics plays a significant role in feature learning within teacher-student frameworks.",

The probing landscape is largely unaffected by moving from the student's initial (θS(1)) to converged (θ*S(1)) state. In the shared view (local and non-local solutions), the student initialized closely to the teacher (θ*S(0)) moves considerably, settling in a different local minimum with high probing accuracy, despite a lower loss barrier compared to θ*S(1)."

              "answer": "Increasing the locality parameter α (from 0 towards 1) gradually separates the student initialization from the teacher. The study shows that random teacher distillation performs similarly for α ∈ [0, 0.6], but increasing α further slows convergence and leads to worse probing performance. Even with α = 1 (independent initialization), there's an improvement over the teacher, but initializing closely (small α) seems to capitalize on the asymmetric valley for better generalization."

              "answer": "The paper shows that student checkpoints (θ*S) are robust to iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) even when rewinding to initialization (l=0), similar to supervised models rewound to epoch 1 or 2. In contrast, fresh random initializations (θS) are not robust to IMP with rewinding to l=0. This suggests that the student's parameter space, even when starting from random initialization, develops properties similar to early-stage supervised training, indicating a structural difference from a purely random initialization."
