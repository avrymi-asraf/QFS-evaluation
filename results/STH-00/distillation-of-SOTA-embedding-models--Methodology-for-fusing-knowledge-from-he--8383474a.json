SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces a novel multi-stage knowledge distillation framework designed to fuse knowledge from multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding models into a smaller student model. The core challenge addressed is the impracticality of deploying large, high-dimensional embedding models in real-world scenarios due to their computational and storage demands. To overcome this, the authors propose a three-loss function approach (cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss) that progressively transfers knowledge from teacher models to the student. This allows the student model to learn semantic representations from diverse perspectives. Furthermore, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed to effectively reduce the vector dimensionality of the student model. The resulting Jasper model, with 2 billion parameters, built upon the Stella embedding model, achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating the efficacy of this distillation methodology for fusing knowledge from heterogeneous teacher models.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   A multi-stage distillation framework is proposed to transfer knowledge from multiple large teacher embedding models to a smaller student model.\n*   Three carefully designed loss functions (cosine loss, similarity loss, relative similarity distillation loss) are used to capture different aspects of teacher knowledge.\n*   Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is utilized for effective vector dimensionality reduction of the student model.\n*   The Jasper student model (2B parameters) achieves performance comparable to 7B parameter models, showcasing the success of the heterogeneous teacher distillation.",

The methodology focuses on enabling a smaller student model (Jasper, with 2B parameters) to learn from multiple state-of-the-art, larger teacher models. The distillation process utilizes three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. Cosine loss aligns absolute text representations, but is noted as insufficient due to limited optimization direction and potential overfitting. Similarity loss addresses this by measuring semantic discrepancies from a text-pair perspective, while relative similarity loss incorporates ranking preferences. To handle the high dimensionality resulting from concatenating teacher model outputs for ground truth, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed for effective dimension reduction. The framework involves a 4-stage training approach: initial distillation stages focusing on different parameter updates, a dimension reduction stage using MRL and additional FC layers, and a final stage for multimodal potential. Jasper achieved a No. 3 position on the MTEB leaderboard, demonstrating performance comparable to 7B parameter models.\n\n2.

The core methodology involves a carefully crafted three-loss function approach: cosine loss for direct vector alignment, similarity loss for semantic matching between text pairs, and relative similarity distillation loss to capture ranking preferences. This allows the student model to learn from multiple teachers by concatenating their outputs to create a ground truth, though this initially leads to high dimensionality. To address this, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is employed for effective dimension reduction.

SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces Jasper, a novel multi-stage distillation framework designed to fuse knowledge from heterogeneous teacher embedding models into a smaller student model. The methodology employs three carefully designed loss functions: cosine loss, similarity loss, and relative similarity distillation loss. These losses progressively guide the student model to learn from teacher representations, moving from specific point-wise alignment to broader text-pair and relative ranking preferences. Jasper, with 2 billion parameters and built upon the Stella embedding model, achieves a strong performance on the MTEB leaderboard, comparable to larger 7B parameter models. The framework utilizes Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for effective dimensionality reduction, addressing the challenge of high vector dimensions from concatenated teacher outputs. The distillation process involves four stages: initial distillation (Stage 1) focusing on a mapping FC layer, followed by training of the last three encoder layers (Stage 2); dimension reduction (Stage 3) using MRL with modified loss functions; and finally, multimodal alignment (Stage 4).\n\n2.
